Screenshot of a Visual Studio Code notebook interface showing an interactive code execution. The text at the top says "Let's start with a simple hello world program." Below is a code cell with the prompt "$ Say "hello!" in emojis" which has been executed in 1.3 seconds, indicated by a checkmark and the time. There are two outputs: one labeled 'user' with the text "Say "hello!" in emojis" and another labeled 'assistant' with a waving hand emoji followed by an exclamation mark.

Once you have a script that you are happy with, you can automate it using the [command line interface](/genaiscript/reference/cli).

## Running a script using the CLI

The basic usage of the CLI is to [run](/genaiscript/reference/cli/run/) a script with a tool name and a list of files.

```sh wrap
npx --yes genaiscript run <script> <...files>
```

The CLI will use the secrets in the `.env` file, populate `env.files` with `<...files>`, run the script
and emit the output to the standard output.

:::tip

[npx](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npx) allows you to run a command 
from the [genaiscript npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/genaiscript) (either one installed locally, or fetched remotely). 
Add `--yes` flag skips the confirmation prompt.

:::

You can use the CLI to run your scripts in a CI/CD pipeline. 
The CLI will return a non-zero exit code if the script fails, which can be used to fail the pipeline.

### Apply Edits

Add the `--apply-edits` flag to the CLI to automatically write the file edits.

```sh wrap "--apply-edits"
npx --yes genaiscript run <script> <...files> --apply-edits
```

:::caution

An LLM maybe generate arbitrary code that can be harmful to your system. 
We recommend that you review the modified code before executing it. This could be done through a separate
branch and a pull request. You can also use a [container](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/container)
to run the script in a sandboxed environment.

Refer to [Security and Trust](/genaiscript/reference/security-and-trust) for more discussion.

## GitHub Action

[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) 
platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. 
This section integrates how to integrate your genai scripts in workflows and pull requests.

### Authentication

Configure the [secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions) 
and [variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables)
on your repository or organization so that GenAIScript can connect to your LLM.

The secrets and variables should match the `.env` file in your local environment.

### Running a script

Use the [cli](/genaiscript/reference/cli/run/) to run the script in a GitHub Action. 
Make sure to pass the secrets and variables to the script.

```yaml
    - run: npx --yes genaiscript run <script> <...files>
        env:
            # variables
            OPENAI_API_TYPE: ${{ env.OPENAI_API_TYPE }}
            OPENAI_API_BASE: ${{ env.OPENAI_API_BASE }}
            # secret, redacted
            OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
```

### Caching LLM queries

GenAIScript stores LLM request caches in the `.genaiscript/cache` folder.
You can use the [actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/cache) action to cache the LLM queries.

```yaml
    - name: cache genaiscript
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
            path: .genaiscript/cache
            key: genaiscript
```

### Annotations

You can use [annotations](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/annotations) to automatically annotate the 
last commit with errors and warnings.

## GitHub Pull request

If your GitHub Action is triggered by a [pull request event](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request),
you can use the following flags to add comments: description, conversation and reviews.

In order to create comments, the workflow must have the `pull-requests: write` [permission](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/assigning-permissions-to-jobs).

```yaml
permissions:
    pull-requests: write
```

### Diff

You can use `host.exec` to execute [git]() command to retrieve information about the current pull request.

```js
const { stdout: changes } = await host.exec("git", [
    "diff",
    "main",
    "--",
    ":!**/genaiscript.d.ts",
    ":!genaisrc/*",
    ":!.github/*",
    ":!.vscode/*",
    ":!yarn.lock",
])

def("GIT_DIFF", changes, {
    language: "diff",
    maxTokens: 20000,
    lineNumbers: false,
})
```

### Update Description

The `--pull-request-description` inserts the LLM output into the pull request section (see [example](https://github.com/microsoft/genaiscript/pull/504)).
The command takes an optional string argument to uniquely identify this comment, it is used to update the comment (default is the script id).

```yaml "--pull-request-description"
- run: npx --yes genaiscript run --pull-request-description
```

If you want to run this script when the pull request is ready for review, use the [`ready_for_review`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request) event.

```yaml
on:
    pull_request:
        types: [ready_for_review]
```

:::note

The comment is enclosed in two XML comments (`<genaiscript begin [id]>`, `<genaiscript end [id]>`) 
to allow for easy identification and removal. Make sure to keep those.

:::

### Conversation comment

The `--pull-request-comment` adds the LLM output as a comment to the pull request conversation (see [example](https://github.com/microsoft/genaiscript/pull/504#issuecomment-2145273728)).
The optional argument is an identifier for the comment (default is the script id).

```yaml "--pull-request-comment"
- run: npx --yes genaiscript run --pull-request-comment
```

### Review comments

Use the `--pull-request-review` to convert [annotations](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/annotations) as review comments 
**to the last commit** on the pull request (see [example](https://github.com/microsoft/genaiscript/pull/504#pullrequestreview-2093960791)).

```yaml "--pull-request-review"
- run: npx --yes genaiscript run --pull-request-review
```

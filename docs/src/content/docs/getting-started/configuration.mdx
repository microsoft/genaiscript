You will need to configure the LLM connection and authorizion secrets.

:::tip

If you do not have access to an LLM, you can try [GitHub Models](#github), [GitHub Copilot Models](#github-copilot) or use a [local model](#local-models) for inferencing.

:::

## Model selection

The model used by the script is configured throught the `model` field in the `script` function.
The model name is formatted as `provider:model-name`, where `provider` is the LLM provider
and the `model-name` is provider specific.

```js 'model: "openai:gpt-4o"'
script({
    model: "openai:gpt-4o",
})
```

You can also use the `small` and `large` aliases to use the default configured small and large models.

```js 'model: "small"'
script({ model: "small" })
```

```js 'model: "large"'
script({ model: "large" })
```

The model can also be overriden from the [cli run command](/genaiscript/reference/cli/run#model)
or by adding the `GENAISCRIPT_DEFAULT_MODEL` and `GENAISCRIPT_DEFAULT_SMALL_MODEL` environment variables.

```txt title=".env"
GENAISCRIPT_DEFAULT_MODEL="azure_serverless:..."
GENAISCRIPT_DEFAULT_SMALL_MODEL="azure_serverless:..."
```

## `.env` file

GenAIScript uses a `.env` file to store the secrets.

<Steps>

<ol>

<li>

Create or update a `.gitignore` file in the root of your project and make it sure it includes `.env`.
This ensures that you do not accidentally commit your secrets to your source control.

```txt title=".gitignore" ".env"
...
.env
```

</li>

<li>

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project.

<FileTree>

-   .gitignore
-   **.env**

</FileTree>

</li>

<li>

Update the `.env` file with the configuration information (see below).

</li>

</ol>

</Steps>

:::caution[Do Not Commit Secrets]

The `.env` file should never be commited to your source control!
If the `.gitignore` file is properly configured,
the `.env` file will appear grayed out in Visual Studio Code.

:::

## OpenAI

This provider, `openai`, is the default provider.
It uses the `OPENAI_API_...` environment variables.

<Steps>

<ol>

<li>
    Create a new secret key from the [OpenAI API Keys
    portal](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
</li>

<li>

Update the `.env` file with the secret key.

```txt title=".env"
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk_...
```

</li>

<li>

Find the model you want to use
from the [OpenAI API Reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4o)
or the [OpenAI Chat Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground/chat).

<Image src={oaiModelsSrc} alt={oaiModelsAlt} loading="lazy" />

</li>

<li>

Set the `model` field in `script` to the model you want to use.

```js 'model: "openai:gpt-4o"'
script({
    model: "openai:gpt-4o",
    ...
})
```

</li>

</ol>

</Steps>

:::tip[Default Model Configuration]

Use `GENAISCRIPT_DEFAULT_MODEL` and `GENAISCRIPT_DEFAULT_SMALL_MODEL` in your `.env` file to set the default model and small model.

```txt
GENAISCRIPT_DEFAULT_MODEL=openai:gpt-4o
GENAISCRIPT_DEFAULT_SMALL_MODEL=openai:gpt-4o-mini
```

:::

## GitHub Models <a id="github" href=""></a>

The [GitHub Models](https://github.com/marketplace/models) provider, `github`, allows running models through the GitHub Marketplace.
This provider is useful for prototyping and subject to [rate limits](https://docs.github.com/en/github-models/prototyping-with-ai-models#rate-limits)
depending on your subscription.

**If you are running from a [GitHub Codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces), the token is already configured for you.**

<Steps>

<ol>

<li>

Create a [GitHub personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new).
The token should not have any scopes or permissions.

</li>

<li>

Update the `.env` file with the token.

```txt title=".env"
GITHUB_TOKEN=...
```

</li>

</ol>

</Steps>

To configure a specific model,

<Steps>

<ol>

<li>

Open the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/models) and find the model you want to use.

</li>

<li>

Copy the model name from the Javascript/Python samples

```js "Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct"
const modelName = "Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct"
```

to configure your script.

```js "Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct"
script({
    model: "github:Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct",
})
```

</li>

</ol>

</Steps>

If you are already using `GITHUB_TOKEN` variable in your script and need a different one
for GitHub Models, you can use the `GITHUB_MODELS_TOKEN` variable instead.

## Azure OpenAI <a id="azure" href=""></a>

The [Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference#chat-completions) provider, `azure` uses the `AZURE_OPENAI_...` environment variables.
You can use a managed identity (recommended) or a API key to authenticate with the Azure OpenAI service.
You can also use a service principal as documented in [automation](/genaiscript/getting-started/automating-scripts).

:::tip

If your are a Visual Studio Subscriber, you can [get free Azure credits](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/member-offers/credit-for-visual-studio-subscribers/)
to try the Azure OpenAI service.

:::

### Managed Identity (Entra ID)

<Steps>

<ol>

<li>

Open your [Azure OpenAI resource](https://portal.azure.com)

</li>
<li>

Navigate to **Access Control**, then **View My Access**. Make sure your
user or service principal has the **Cognitive Services OpenAI User/Contributor** role.
If you get a `401` error, it's typically here that you will fix it.

</li>
<li>
Navigate to **Resource Management**, then **Keys and Endpoint**.
</li>
<li>

Update the `.env` file with the endpoint.

```txt title=".env"
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://....openai.azure.com
```

:::note

Make sure to remove any `AZURE_API_KEY`, `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` entries from `.env` file.

:::

</li>

<li>

Navigate to **deployments** and make sure that you have your LLM deployed and copy the `deployment-id`, you will need it in the script.

</li>

<li>

Open a terminal and **login** with [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/overview/azure/identity-readme?view=azure-node-latest#authenticate-via-the-azure-cli).

```sh
az login
```

</li>

<li>

Update the `model` field in the `script` function to match the model deployment name in your Azure resource.

```js 'model: "azure:deployment-id"'
script({
    model: "azure:deployment-id",
    ...
})
```

</li>

</ol>

</Steps>

### API Key

<Steps>

<ol>

<li>

Open your [Azure OpenAI resource](https://portal.azure.com) and navigate to **Resource Management**, then **Keys and Endpoint**.

</li>

<li>

Update the `.env` file with the secret key (**Key 1** or **Key 2**) and the endpoint.

```txt title=".env"
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=...
AZURE_OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT=https://....openai.azure.com
```

</li>

<li>

The rest of the steps are the same: Find the deployment name and use it in your script, `model: "azure:deployment-id"`.

</li>

</ol>

</Steps>

## Azure AI Models (Serverless APIs) <a id="azure_serverless" href=""></a>

Certain models in the model catalog can be deployed as [a serverless API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/deploy-models-serverless-availability) with pay-as-you-go billing.
This kind of deployment provides a way to consume models
as an API without hosting them on your subscription,
while keeping the enterprise security and compliance that organizations need.
This deployment option doesn't require quota from your subscription.

### API Key

<Steps>

<ol>

<li>

Open https://ai.azure.com/ and open the **Deployments** page.

</li>

<li>

Deploy a **base model** from the catalog.
You can use the `Deployment Options` -> `Serverless API` option to deploy a model as a serverless API.

</li>

<li>

Configure the **Endpoint Target URL** as the `AZURE_INFERENCE_ENDPOINT` variable and the key in
`AZURE_INFERENCE_CREDENTIAL` in the `.env` file.

```txt title=".env"
AZURE_INFERENCE_ENDPOINT=https://...models.ai.azure.com
AZURE_INFERENCE_CREDENTIAL=...
```

</li>

<li>

Find the deployment name and use it in your script, `model: "azure_serverless:deployment-id"`.

</li>

</ol>

</Steps>

Note: better support will come in future versions.

## GitHub Copilot Chat Models <a id="github-copilot" href=""></a>

If you have access to **GitHub Copilot Chat in Visual Studio Code**,
GenAIScript will be able to leverage those [language models](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/language-model) as well.

This mode is useful to run your scripts without having a separate LLM provider or local LLMs. However, those models are not available from the command line
and have additional limitations and rate limiting defined by the GitHub Copilot platform.

There is no configuration needed as long as you have GitHub Copilot installed and configured in Visual Studio Code.
You can force using this model by using `client:*` as a model name.

<Steps>

<ol>

<li>

Install [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat) (emphasis on **Chat**)

</li>

<li>run your script</li>
<li>

Confirm that you are allowing GenAIScript to use the GitHub Copilot Chat models.

</li>
<li>
select the best chat model that matches the one you have in your script

<Image src={lmSelectSrc} alt={lmSelectAlt} loading="lazy" />

(This step is skipped if you already have mappings in your settings)

</li>

</ol>

</Steps>

The mapping of GenAIScript model names to Visual Studio Models is stored in the settings.

## Local Models

There are many projects that allow you to run models locally on your machine,
or in a container.

### LocalAI

[LocalAI](https://localai.io/) act as a drop-in replacement REST API that’s compatible
with OpenAI API specifications for local inferencing. It uses free Open Source models
and it runs on CPUs.

LocalAI acts as an OpenAI replacement, you can see the [model name mapping](https://localai.io/basics/container/#all-in-one-images)
used in the container, like `gpt-4` is mapped to `phi-2`.

<Steps>

<ol>

<li>

Install Docker. See the [LocalAI documentation](https://localai.io/basics/getting_started/#prerequisites) for more information.

</li>

<li>

Update the `.env` file and set the api type to `localai`.

```txt title=".env" "localai"
OPENAI_API_TYPE=localai
```

</li>

</ol>

</Steps>

### Ollama

[Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) is a desktop application that let you download and run model locally.

Running tools locally may require additional GPU resources depending on the model you are using.

Use the `ollama` provider to access Ollama models.

<Steps>

<ol>

<li>

Start the Ollama application or

```sh
ollama serve
```

</li>

<li>

Update your script to use the `ollama:phi3` model.

```js "ollama:phi3"
script({
    ...,
    model: "ollama:phi3",
})
```

</li>

</ol>

</Steps>

### Llamafile

[https://llamafile.ai/](https://llamafile.ai/) is a single file desktop application
that allows you to run an LLM locally.

The provider is `llamafile` and the model name is ignored.

### Jan, LMStudio, LLaMA.cpp

[Jan](https://jan.ai/), [LMStudio](https://lmstudio.ai/),
[LLaMA.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/tree/master/examples/server)
also allow running models locally or interfacing with other LLM vendors.

<Steps>

<ol>

<li>

Update the `.env` file with the local server information.

```txt title=".env"
OPENAI_API_BASE=http://localhost:...
```

</li>

</ol>

</Steps>

### Model specific environment variables

You can provide different environment variables
for each named model by using the `PROVIDER_MODEL_API_...` prefix or `PROVIDER_API_...` prefix.
The model name is capitalized and
all non-alphanumeric characters are converted to `_`.

This allows to have various sources of LLM computations
for different models. For example, to enable the `ollama:phi3`
model running locally, while keeping the default `openai` model connection information.

```txt title=".env"
OLLAMA_PHI3_API_BASE=http://localhost:11434/v1
```

## Checking your configuration

You can check your configuration by running the `genaiscript info env` [command](/genaiscript/reference/cli).
It will display the current configuration information parsed by GenAIScript.

```sh
genaiscript info env
```

## Next steps

Write your [first script](/genaiscript/getting-started/your-first-genai-script).

GenAIScript is a scripting language that integrates LLMs into the scripting process using a simplified JavaScript syntax.
It allows users to create, debug, and automate LLM-based scripts.

GenAIScript brings the flexibility of JavaScript with the convenience of built-in output parsing
to streamline the creation of LLM-based software solutions.

## script = prompt generator

The following script generates a prompt that
takes files (.txt, .pdf, .docx) as input and
saves the summaries in another files.

```js wrap title="summarize.genai.mjs" system=false assistant=true user=true
// context: define a "FILE" variable
const file = def("FILE", env.files)
// task: appends text to the prompt (file is the variable name)
$`Summarize ${file} in one sentence. Save output to ${file}.summary`
```

<!-- genaiscript output start -->

<details style="margin-left: 1rem;"  open>
<summary>ðŸ‘¤ user</summary>


````markdown wrap
FILE:
```txt file="src/samples/markdown-small.txt"
What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the worldâ€™s most popular markup languages. 
```

Summarize FILE in one sentence. Save output to FILE.summary
````


</details>


<details style="margin-left: 1rem;"  open>
<summary>ðŸ¤– assistant</summary>


````markdown wrap
File src/samples/markdown-small.txt.summary:
```txt
Markdown is a lightweight markup language created by John Gruber in 2004, known for adding formatting elements to plaintext text documents.
```
````


</details>

<!-- genaiscript output end -->



GenAIScript will execute `summarize.genai.js` and generate the `ðŸ‘¤ user` message that will be sent to the LLM chat. It also populates the `env.files` variable with the files selected in the context (from a user UI interaction or CLI arguments).

The LLM responds with the `ðŸ¤– assistant` message and GenAIScript parses the output
to extract structured data.

## LLM invocation

All the generated prompts are formatted and sent to the LLM server, which can be remote like [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create) or running locally like [ollama](https://ollama.com/) (there are many other LLM providers).

```json
{
    "model": "gpt4",
    "messages": [
        { "role": "system", "content": "When generating... " },
        { "role": "user", "content": "FILE src/samples/...:" }
    ]
}
```

## Output parsing

The LLM responds with a text which can be parsed for various micro-formats,
like markdown code fences, files or annotations.

GenAIScript automatically makes sense of the output and exposes it through a [Refactoring Preview](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/refactoring#_refactor-preview) or directly saved to the file system.

Of course, things can get more complex - with functions, schemas, ... -, but this is the basic flow of a GenAIScript script.

## Next steps

Let's start by [installing the extension in Visual Studio Code](/genaiscript/getting-started/installation).

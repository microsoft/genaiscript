GenAIScript use stylized JavaScript with minimal syntax.
They are stored as files (`genaisrc/*.genai.js`) in your project.
The execution of a genaiscript creates the prompt that will be sent to the LLM.

<Steps>
<ol>
<li>

<CreateScript />

</li><li>

The resulting file will be placed in the `genaisrc` folder in your project.

<FileTree>

-   â€¦
-   genaisrc scripts are created here by default
    -   genaiscript.d.ts (TypeScript type definitions)
    -   jsconfig.json (TypeScript compiler configuration)
    -   **proofreader.genai.js**
    -   â€¦
-   â€¦

</ol>
</Steps>

## the prompt

The execution of the GenAIScript generates a prompt (and more)
that gets sent to the LLM model.

The ` $``...`` ` template string function formats and write the string to the prompt; which gets sent to the LLM.

```js title="poem.genai.js"
$`Write a one sentence poem.`
```

## Files

When generating or updating files you will use the following syntax:
File ./file1.ts:

```typescript
What goes in
./file1.ts.
```

File ./file1.py:

```python
What goes in
./file1.py.
```

File /path_to_file/file2.md:

```markdown
What goes in
/path_to_file/file2.md.
```

Make sure to use precisely ``` to guard file code sections.
Make sure to use precisely ````` to guard file markdown sections.
Use full path of filename in code section header.
If a file does not have changes, do not regenerate.
Do NOT emit line numbers in file.
CSV files are inlined as markdown tables.

## the Context

GenAIScript exposes the context through the `env` variable. The context is implicitly defined by the location you start executing the script.

-   you can right click on a folder and the `env.files` will contain all the files nested in that folder.
-   you can right click on or in a file and the `env.files` will contain only that file.
-   you can run the script using the [command line interface](/genaiscript/reference/cli) and specify content of `env.files` in the CLI arguments.

```js title="proofreader.genai.js"
def("FILES", env.files)
```

The `def` function inlines the content of `env.files` in the final prompt in a LLM friendly way. It also has a number of additional options to control precisely how the content should be inlined.

```js title="proofreader.genai.js"
def("FILES", env.files, {
    // line numbers help with generating diffs
    lineNumber: true,
    // filter .md files only
    endsWith: ".md",
})
```

## the Task

The `$` function is used to build the prompt text, it renders and writes the text to the prompt
(`$` is a [template literal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)).

```js title="proofreader.genai.js"
def("FILES", env.files)
$`You are an expert technical writer and proofreader.
Review the documents in FILE and report the 5 most important issues.`
```

What is Markdown?
 Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the worldâ€™s most popular markup languages. 

Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isnâ€™t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.

For example, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., **this text is bold**). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if youâ€™re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications. The screenshot below shows a Markdown file displayed in the Visual Studio Code text editor....

### Issues in "Markdown.md"

1. **Lack of Consistency**: The document lacks consistency in the use of Markdown syntax. For example, it uses both the number sign (#) and the word "Heading" to denote headings. Consistency in syntax usage is crucial for clarity and readability.

2. **Explanation Complexity**: The explanation of Markdown is overly complex and may not be easily understandable for beginners. It could benefit from simplification and more concise language to make it more accessible.

3. **Visual Aids**: While the document mentions a screenshot showing a Markdown file in Visual Studio Code, it would be beneficial to include the actual screenshot or more visual aids to help readers better understand the concept.

4. **Examples**: The document briefly mentions examples of Markdown syntax but could benefit from more comprehensive and varied examples to illustrate different formatting elements.

5. **Introduction Clarity**: The introduction could be improved to clearly state the purpose and benefits of using Markdown, providing a more compelling reason for readers to continue engaging with the document.

Overall, the document would benefit from improved consistency, simplification of explanations, inclusion of visual aids, more comprehensive examples, and a clearer introduction.

`$` supports placeholders, `${...}`. You also can reference
the LLM variable defined with `def` freely in the text as well.

```js title="proofreader.genai.js"
const files = def("FILE", env.files)
const n = 5
$`Review the documents in ${files} 
  and report the ${n} most important issues.`
```

## the Metadata

You can add a call to the `script` function to provides metadata about the script
and the model. The metadata is used to display the script in the UI and configure the LLM model.

```js title="proofreader.genai.js"
// the metadata
script({
    // user interface
    title: "Technical proofreading",
    description: "Reviews the text as a tech writer.",
    group: "documentation",
    // model
    temperature: 0,
})
```

The `title`, `description`, and `group` properties are used to display the script in the UI
and can be helpful when the user is searching for a script.

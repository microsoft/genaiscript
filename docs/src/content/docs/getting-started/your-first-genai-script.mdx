GenAIScript use stylized JavaScript with minimal syntax.
They are stored as files (`genaisrc/*.genai.js`) in your project.
The execution of a genaiscript creates the prompt that will be sent to the LLM.

<Steps>
<ol>
<li>

<CreateScript />

</li><li>

The resulting file will be placed in the `genaisrc` folder in your project.

<FileTree>

-   â€¦
-   genaisrc scripts are created here by default
    -   genaiscript.d.ts (TypeScript type definitions)
    -   jsconfig.json (TypeScript compiler configuration)
    -   **proofreader.genai.js**
    -   â€¦
-   â€¦

</FileTree>

</li>
</ol>
</Steps>

## the Prompt

The execution of the GenAIScript generates a prompt (and more)
that gets sent to the LLM model.

The ` $``...`` ` template string function formats and write the string to the prompt; which gets sent to the LLM.

```js title="poem.genai.js" system=false assistant=true
$`Write a one sentence poem.`
```

```

```markdown wrap
Roses bloom, hearts entwine, love's sweet embrace.
```


</details>

{/* genaiscript output end */}



## the Context

GenAIScript exposes the context through the `env` variable. The context is implicitly defined by the location you start executing the script.

-   you can right click on a folder and the `env.files` will contain all the files nested in that folder.
-   you can right click on or in a file and the `env.files` will contain only that file.
-   you can run the script using the [command line interface](/genaiscript/reference/cli) and specify content of `env.files` in the CLI arguments.

```js title="proofreader.genai.js" system=false assistant=false
def("FILES", env.files)
```

What is Markdown?
 Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the worldâ€™s most popular markup languages. 

Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isnâ€™t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.

For example, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., **this text is bold**). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if youâ€™re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications. The screenshot below shows a Markdown file displayed in the Visual Studio Code text editor....

## the Task

The `$` function is used to build the prompt text, it renders and writes the text to the prompt
(`$` is a [template literal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)).

```js title="proofreader.genai.js"
def("FILES", env.files)
$`You are an expert technical writer and proofreader.
Review the documents in FILE and report the 5 most important issues.`

- Inconsistent capitalization: The document switches between using "Markdown" and "markdown" inconsistently. It should be standardized to either capitalize or lowercase the term throughout the document.
- Lack of examples: While the document explains how to format text using Markdown, it could benefit from more examples to illustrate the syntax and its application.
- Ambiguity in explanation: The explanation of Markdown's difference from WYSIWYG editors could be clearer. It currently states that "Markdown isnâ€™t like that," which may not be clear to all readers.
- Visual aids: The document mentions a screenshot but does not include it. Adding visual aids can enhance the understanding of the content, especially for those new to Markdown.
- Lack of real-world use cases: Providing real-world examples of how Markdown is commonly used could help readers understand its practical applications better.

## the Metadata

You can add a call to the `script` function to provides metadata about the script
and the model. The metadata is used to display the script in the UI and configure the LLM model.

```js title="proofreader.genai.js"
// the metadata
script({
    // user interface
    title: "Technical proofreading",
    description: "Reviews the text as a tech writer.",
    group: "documentation",
    // model
    temperature: 0,
})

## Calculating the Area of a Circle

The formula to calculate the area of a circle is:

\[ A = \pi r^2 \]

Where:
- \( A \) = area of the circle
- \( \pi \) is a constant approximately equal to 3.14159
- \( r \) = radius of the circle

To calculate the area of a circle, you can use the formula \( A = \pi r^2 \), where \( r \) is the radius of the circle.

## Python Implementation

File ./circle_area.py:
```python
import math

def calculate_circle_area(radius):
    return math.pi * radius**2
```

## TypeScript Implementation

File ./circleArea.ts:
```typescript
function calculateCircleArea(radius: number): number {
    return Math.PI * Math.pow(radius, 2);
}
```

These implementations provide functions to calculate the area of a circle given its radius.

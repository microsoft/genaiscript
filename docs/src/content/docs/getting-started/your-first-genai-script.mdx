GenAIScript use stylized JavaScript with minimal syntax.
They are stored as files (`genaisrc/*.genai.js`) in your project.
The execution of a genaiscript creates the prompt that will be sent to the LLM.

<Steps>
<ol>
<li>

<CreateScript />

</li><li>

The resulting file will be placed in the `genaisrc` folder in your project.

<FileTree>

-   â€¦
-   genaisrc scripts are created here by default
    -   genaiscript.d.ts (TypeScript type definitions)
    -   jsconfig.json (TypeScript compiler configuration)
    -   **proofreader.genai.js**
    -   â€¦
-   â€¦

</FileTree>

</li>
</ol>
</Steps>

## the prompt

The execution of the GenAIScript generates a prompt (and more)
that gets sent to the LLM model.

The ` $``...`` ` template string function formats and write the string to the prompt; which gets sent to the LLM.

```js title="poem.genai.js"
$`Write a one sentence poem.`
```

## the Context

GenAIScript exposes the context through the `env` variable. The context is implicitly defined by the location you start executing the script.

-   you can right click on a folder and the `env.files` will contain all the files nested in that folder.
-   you can right click on or in a file and the `env.files` will contain only that file.
-   you can run the script using the [command line interface](/genaiscript/reference/cli) and specify content of `env.files` in the CLI arguments.

```js title="proofreader.genai.js"
// the context
def("FILES", env.files)
```

The `def` function inlines the content of `env.files` in the final prompt in a LLM friendly way. It also has a number of additional options to control precisely how the content should be inlined.

```js title="proofreader.genai.js"
def("FILES", env.files, {
    // line numbers help with generating diffs
    lineNumber: true,
    // filter .md files only
    endsWith: ".md",
})
```

## the Task

The `$` function is used to build the prompt text, it renders and writes the text to the prompt
(`$` is a [template literal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)).

```js title="proofreader.genai.js"
def("FILES", env.files)
// the task
$`You are an expert technical writer and proofreader.

What is Markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the worldâ€™s most popular markup languages.

Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isnâ€™t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.

For example, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., **this text is bold**). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if youâ€™re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications. The screenshot below shows a Markdown file displayed in the Visual Studio Code text editor....

```markdown
The 5 most important issues in the provided markdown document are:

1. **Lack of Consistency**: The document lacks consistency in the use of examples. For instance, it uses both "e.g.," and "for example," to introduce examples. This inconsistency can be confusing for readers.

2. **Clarity**: The document could benefit from clearer explanations of Markdown syntax. It should provide more detailed examples and explanations to help readers understand how to use Markdown effectively.

3. **Visual Aids**: The document mentions a screenshot but does not include it. Adding visual aids, such as screenshots or diagrams, can enhance the understanding of the content.

4. **Introduction**: The document lacks a clear and engaging introduction that captures the reader's attention and provides a brief overview of what Markdown is and its benefits.

5. **Formatting**: The document does not consistently apply formatting to the Markdown syntax examples. Using consistent formatting for code snippets and examples can improve readability and comprehension.

These issues should be addressed to improve the overall quality and clarity of the document.

`$` supports placeholders, `${...}`. You also can reference
the LLM variable defined with `def` freely in the text as well.

```js title="proofreader.genai.js"
const files = def("FILE", env.files)
const n = 5
$`Review the documents in ${files} 
  and report the ${n} most important issues.`
```

## the Metadata

You can add a call to the `script` function to provides metadata about the script
and the model. The metadata is used to display the script in the UI and configure the LLM model.

```js title="proofreader.genai.js"
// the metadata
script({
    // user interface
    title: "Technical proofreading",
    description: "Reviews the text as a tech writer.",
    group: "documentation",
    // model
    temperature: 0,
})
```

The `title`, `description`, and `group` properties are used to display the script in the UI
and can be helpful when the user is searching for a script.

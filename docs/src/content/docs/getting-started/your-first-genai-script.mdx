GenAIScript use stylized JavaScript with minimal syntax. 
They are stored as files (`genaisrc/*.genai.js`) in your project.
The execution of a genaiscript creates the prompt that will be sent to the LLM.

<Steps>
<ol>
<li>

<CreateScript />

</li><li>

The resulting file will be placed in the `genaisrc` folder in your project.

<FileTree>

- â€¦
- genaisrc scripts are created here by default
  - genaiscript.d.ts (TypeScript type definitions)
  - jsconfig.json (TypeScript compiler configuration)
  - **proofreader.genai.js**

</Steps>

## the prompt

The execution of the GenAIScript generates a prompt (and more) 
that gets sent to the LLM model. 

The ` $``...`` ` template string function formats and write the string to the prompt; which gets sent to the LLM.

```js title="poem.genai.js"
$`Write a one sentence poem.`
```

```md title="ðŸ¤–" wrap
In the quiet dusk, the willow whispers secrets to the passing breeze.
```


## the Context

GenAIScript exposes the context through the `env` variable. The context is implicitly defined by the location you start executing the script.

-   you can right click on a folder and the `env.files` will contain all the files nested in that folder.
-   you can right click on or in a file and the `env.files` will contain only that file.
-   you can run the script using the [command line interface](/genaiscript/reference/cli) and specify content of `env.files` in the CLI arguments.

```js title="proofreader.genai.js"
// the context
def("FILES", env.files)
```

The `def` function inlines the content of `env.files` in the final prompt in a LLM friendly way. It also has a number of additional options to control precisely how the content should be inlined.

```js title="proofreader.genai.js"
def("FILES", env.files, {
    // line numbers help with generating diffs
    lineNumber: true,
    // filter .md files only
    endsWith: ".md",
})
```

## the Task

The `$` function is used to build the prompt text, it renders and writes the text to the prompt
(`$` is a [template literal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)).

```js title="proofreader.genai.js"
// the task
$`You are an expert technical writer and proofreader.

Review the documents in FILE and report the 5 most important issues.`
```

`$` supports placeholders, `${...}`. You also can reference 
the LLM variable defined with `def` freely in the text as well.

```js title="proofreader.genai.js"
const files = def("FILE", env.files)
const n = 5
$`Review the documents in ${files} 
  and report the ${n} most important issues.`
```

## the Metadata

You can add a call to the `script` function to provides metadata about the script
and the model. The metadata is used to display the script in the UI and configure the LLM model.

```js title="proofreader.genai.js"
// the metadata
script({
    // user interface
    title: "Technical proofreading",
    description: "Reviews the text as a tech writer.",
    group: "documentation",
    // model
    temperature: 0
})
```

The `title`, `description`, and `group` properties are used to display the script in the UI
and can be helpful when the user is searching for a script.

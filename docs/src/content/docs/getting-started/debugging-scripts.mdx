The GenAIScript script files are executable JavaScript and can be debugged
using the [Visual Studio Code Debugger], just like any other JavaScript program.

<Image src={src} alt={alt}/>

## Starting a debugging session

- Open the `.genai.js` file to debug and add breakpoints.
- Right click in the editor of the file you want in `env.files`.
- Select the GenAiScript from the picker.

The debugger will launch the [cli](/genaiscript/reference/cli) and run the script in debug mode.
The debugger will stop at the breakpoints you set.

## Limitations

The JavaScript executes in an external node process. Therefore,

- The trace preview and output is not supported while debugging.

## Next steps

Keep iterating the script or [automated it in your CI/CD](/genaiscript/getting-started/automating-scripts).

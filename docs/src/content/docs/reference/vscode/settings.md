## CLI

These settings control how the GenAIScript server
is run from the extension.
By default, the extension uses [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) and the current extension version to run the GenAIScript CLI.

```sh
npx --yes genaiscript@[extension_version] serve
```

## Path

If you have a specific version of the CLI installed, you can set the path to it here.

## Version

By default, the extension uses npx and the current extension version. You can override the version number with this setting.

```sh
node cli_path serve
```

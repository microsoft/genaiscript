The GenAIScript extension for Visual Studio Code provides a convenient way to run scripts directly from the editor.

There are mostly two ways of running scripts:

- running a script "directly". This scenario is useful when debugging a script
  or for a script that does not require any input files.
- running a script from input files or folders. This scenario is useful when you want to run a script on multiple files or folders.

## Running Scripts directly

- open a GenAIScript file in the editor
- right-click in the editor and select **Run GenAIScript\*** form the content menu
- or click on on the **Run GenAIScript** icon in the top right corner of the editor

This will start the script execution and use the default input files specify in the `script` `files` field.

```js 'files'
script({
    files: "...",    
})
```

This mode is useful when developing script or for scripts that do not require any input files.

## Running Scripts from input files or folders

This mode allows to run scripts on any combination of files and folders, which will populate `env.files`.

### From the explorer window:

- select any files or folders in the explorer. You can use the `Ctrl` or `Shift` key to select multiple files or folders.
- right-click and select **Run GenAIScript** from the context menu

### From an editor

- open an file in the editor (not a GenAIScript file)
- right-click and select **Run GenAIScript** from the context menu

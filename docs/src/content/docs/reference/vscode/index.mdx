    alt: An 8-bit style icon features a blue Visual Studio Code logo, a basic
      computer monitor displaying colored UI sections and simple code lines, and
      a download arrow, all created with clean geometric shapes and five
      distinct colors, set against a plain background with no people or text.
      The design is minimalistic and corporate in appearance at a small, square
      resolution.

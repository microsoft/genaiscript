The `@genaiscript` [chat participant](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/chat#parts-of-the-chat-user-experience) lets your run scripts without the context
of a [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat) conversation.
This is useful for leverage existing scripts in an interactive chat session.

## Choosing which script to run

The `/run` command expects a script id as the first argument (e.g., `/run poem`). The rest of the query is
passed to the script as the `env.vars.question` variable.

```sh
@genaiscript /run summarize
```

If you omit the `/run` command, GenAIScript will look for a script named `copilotchat`. If it finds one, it will run it.
Otherwise, it will propose you to create a new script.

```sh
@genaiscript add comments to the current editor
```

## Context

The context selected by the user in Copilot Chat is converted to variables and passed to the script:

- the prompt content is passed in `env.vars.question`. The script id is removed in the case of `/run`.
- the current editor text is passed in `env.vars["copilot.editor"]`
- the current editor selection is passed in `env.vars["copilot.selection"]`
- the file references are passed in `env.files`

## Default script

The following script is used as a starter template to create the default script when the user does not use the `/run` command.

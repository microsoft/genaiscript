    alt: A small, square 8-bit style image shows a simplified computer monitor on a
      plain white background. The monitor screen contains graphic
      representations of adjustment sliders and toggle switches, all depicted
      with clean, flat shapes. The overall design uses five distinct, solid
      colors reminiscent of Visual Studio Codeâ€™s palette, arranged minimally
      with no people, writing, shadows, gradients, or reflections. The image is
      highly geometric and stylized, measuring 128 by 128 pixels.

GenAIScript provides APIs to post a message, with file attachments, to a given
[Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/) channel
and it's SharePoint File share.

- using the CLI, posting the result of the AI generation

```sh "--teams-message"
genaiscript run ... --teams-message
```

- using the API, posting a message with attachments

```js
const channel = await host.teamsChannel()
await channel.postMessage("Hello, World!")
```

## Authentication

GenAIScript uses the Azure authentication client to interact with the Microsoft Graph.
Login to your account using the Azure CLI.

```sh
az login
```

## Configuration

To use the Microsoft Teams integration with the [CLI](/genaiscript/reference/cli),
you need to provide a link url to a Teams channel.

```txt .env
GENAISCRIPT_TEAMS_CHANNEL_URL=https://teams.microsoft.com/l/...
```

## API

The API works by create a client for the channel, then calling `postMessage`.

```js
const channel = await host.teamsChannel()
await channel.postMessage("Hello, World!")
```

You can also attach files to the message.
The files will be uploaded to the SharePoint Files folder.

```js
await channel.postMessage("Hello, World!", {
    files: [{ filename: "file.txt" }],
})
```

Add a description to the file to populate this metdata.
The description can be in markdown and will be rendered to Teams HTML as much as possible.

```js
await channel.postMessage("Cool video!", {
    files: [
        {
            filename: "video.mp4",
            description: `Title
description`,
        },
    ],
})
```

For videos, GenAIScript will split the description into a subject/message
to populate both entries in Microsoft Stream.

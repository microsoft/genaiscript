description: Search for patterns in the AST of a script
---

[ast-grep](https://ast-grep.github.io/) is a fast and polyglot tool for code structural search, lint, rewriting at large scale.

GenAISCript provides a wrapper around `ast-grep` to search for patterns in the AST of a script,
and transform the AST. This is a very efficient way to create scripts that modify source code as one is able
to surgically target specific parts of the code.

## Playground

The [online playground](https://ast-grep.github.io/playground.html) allows you to experiment with the tool without installing it.

## llms.txt

**ast-grep** provides a [llms.txt](https://ast-grep.github.io/llms-full.txt) file that will help your copilot generate rules and patterns.
Add it to your Copilot context for best results.

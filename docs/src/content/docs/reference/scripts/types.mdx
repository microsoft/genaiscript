    alt: A small, square icon features a simple geometric document outlined in one
      of five corporate colors, with angled brackets and abstract interface
      shapes on its surface to represent coding. The document contains dot and
      dash marks to suggest programming elements, all set against a plain,
      untextured background. The style is flat, minimal, and pixelated, with no
      shading, shadows, gradients, or any 3D effects. No people or text appear
      in the image.

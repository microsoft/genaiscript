GenAIScript defines an **agent** as a [tool](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/tools) that
runs an [inline prompt](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/inline-prompts) to accomplish a task. The agent LLM is typically augmented with
additional tools.

## Agent flow engine

**GenAIScript does _not_ implement any agentic workflow or decision.**
It relies entierly on [tools](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/tools) support builtin to the LLMs.

## defAgent

The `defAgent` function is used to define an agent that can be called by the LLM. It takes a JSON schema to define the input and expects a string output. The LLM decides to call this agent on its own!

```ts
defAgent(
    "git", // agent id becomes 'agent_git'
    "Handles any git operation", // description
    "You are a helpful expert in using git.",
    {
        tools: ["git"],
    }
)
```

-   the agent id will become the tool id `agent_<id>`
-   the description of the agent will automatically be augmented with information about the available tools

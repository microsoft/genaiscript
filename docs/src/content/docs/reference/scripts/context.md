The information about the context of the script execution are available in the `env` global object.

## Environment (`env`)

The `env` global object contains properties that provide information about the script execution context.
`env` is populated automatically by the GenAIScript runtime.

### `env.files`

The `env.files` array contains all files within the execution context. The context is defined implicitly
by the user based on:

-   `script` `files` option

```js
script({
    files: "**/*.pdf",
})
```

or multiple paths

```js
script({
    files: ["src/*.pdf", "other/*.pdf"],
})
```

-   the UI location to start the tool

-   [CLI](/genaiscript/reference/cli) files arguments.

The files are stored in `env.files` which can be injected in the prompt.

-   directly in a `$` call

```js
$`Summarize ${env.files}.
```

-   using `def`

```js
def("FILE", env.files)
```

-   filtered,

```js
def("DOCS", env.files, { endsWith: ".md" })
def("CODE", env.files, { endsWith: ".py" })
```

### `env.vars`

The `vars` property contains the variables that have been defined in the script execution context.

```javascript
// grab locale from variable or default to en-US
const locale = env.vars.locale || "en-US"
```

Read more about [variables](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/variables).

## Definition (`def`)

The `def("FILE", file)` function is a shorthand for generating a fenced variable output.
The "meta-variable" (`FILE` in this example) name should be all uppercase (but can include

```js "def"
def("FILE", file)
```

approximately equivalent to:

````js
$`FILE ${file.filename}:
```
${env.file.content}
```
````

The `def` function can also be used with an array of files, such as `env.files`.

```js "env.files"
def("FILE", env.files)
```

### Language

You can specify the language of the text contained in `def`. This can help GenAIScript optimize the rendering of the text.

```js 'language: "diff"'
// hint that the output is a diff
def("DIFF", gitdiff, { language: "diff" })
```

### Referencing

The `def` function returns a variable name that can be used in the prompt.
The name might be formatted diferently to accommodate the model's preference.

```js "const f = "
const f = def("FILE", file)

$`Summarize ${f}.`
```

### File filters

Since a script may be executed on a full folder, it is often useful to filter the files based on

-   their extension

```js "endsWith: '.md'"
def("FILE", env.files, { endsWith: ".md" })
```

-   or using a [glob](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)>):

```js "glob: '**/*.{md,mdx}'"
def("FILE", files, { glob: "**/*.{md,mdx}" })
```

:::tip

You can open the completion menu and discover all the options
by pressing **Ctrl+Space** after the curly brace `{` character.

```js
def("FILE", env.files, { // press Ctrl+Space
```

### Empty files

By default, if `def` is used with an empty array of files, it will cancel the prompt. You can override this behavior
by setting `ignoreEmpty` to `true`.

```js "ignoreEmpty: true"
def("FILE", env.files, { endsWith: ".md", ignoreEmpty: true })
```

### `maxTokens`

It is possible to limit the number of tokens that are generated by the `def` function. This can be useful when the output is too large and the model has a token limit.
The `maxTokens` option can be set to a number to limit the number of tokens generated **for each indivial file**.

```js "maxTokens: 100"
def("FILE", env.files, { maxTokens: 100 })
```

### Data filters

The `def` function treats data files such as [CSV](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/csv) and [XLSX](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/xlsx) specially. It will automatically convert the data into a
markdown table format to improve tokenization.

-   `sliceHead`, keep the top N rows

```js "sliceHead: 100"
def("FILE", env.files, { sliceHead: 100 })
```

-   `sliceTail`, keep the last N rows

```js "sliceTail: 100"
def("FILE", env.files, { sliceTail: 100 })
```

-   `sliceSample`, keep a random sample of N rows

```js "sliceSample: 100"
def("FILE", env.files, { sliceSample: 100 })
```

## Data definition (`defData`)

The `defData` function offers additional formatting options for converting a data object into a textual representation. It supports rendering objects as YAML, JSON, or CSV (formatted as a markdown table).

```js
// render to mardownified CSV by default
defData("DATA", data)

// render as yaml
defData("DATA", csv, { format: "yaml" })
```

The `defData` function also support functions to slice the input rows and columns.

-   `headers`, list of column names to include
-   `sliceHead`, number of rows to include from the beginning
-   `sliceTail`, number of rows to include from the end
-   `sliceSample`, number of rows to pick at random
-   `distinct`, list of column names to deduplicate the data based on

```js
defData("DATA", data, {
    sliceHead: 5,
    sliceTail: 5,
    sliceSample: 100,
})
```

## Diff Definition (`defDiff`)

It is very common to compare two piece of data and ask the LLM to analyze the differences. Using diffs is a great way
to naturally compress the information since we only reason about differences!

The `defDiff` takes care of formatting the diff in a way that helps LLM reason. It behaves similarly to `def` and assigns
a name to the diff.

```js
// diff files
defDiff("DIFF", env.files[0], env.files[1])

// diff strings
defDiff("DIFF", "cat", "dog")

// diff objects
defDiff("DIFF", { name: "cat" }, { name: "dog" })
```

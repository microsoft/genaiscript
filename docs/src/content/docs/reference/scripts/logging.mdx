GenAIScript uses the [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) library for logging.
It is a very flexible and powerful logging library that allows you to enable or disable logging for specific namespaces.

## Script logger

The `env.dbg` is a debug logger with your script id as the namespace. Debug logger messages are _not_ sent to the markdown trace.

```js title="poem.genai.mjs"
// put this at the top of your script
// so you can use `dbg` throughout the file
const { dbg } = env

dgb("This is a debug message!")
```

The script messages are visible by running with `DEBUG=<scriptid>`.

```sh
DEBUG=poem genaiscript run ...
```

## Custom loggers

You can use the `host.logger` to create a custom logger with a specific namespace.

```js 'host.logger("sample")'
const d = host.logger("sample")
```

- log away!

```js
d("This is a debug message")
d("This is a debug message with a variable: %s", "variable")
d("This is a debug message with an object: %o", { key: "value" })

console.log("To see log messages, run the script with DEBUG=genai:sample")
console.log("DEBUG=sample genaiscript run debug")
```

## Seeing the logs

By default, the logging is disabled. To turn it on,
you need to set the `DEBUG` environment variable to the namespace you want to enable.
For example, to enable logging for the `sample` namespace, you can run the script like this:

```bash
DEBUG=sample genaiscript run debug
```

And you will see the following output:

```txt
  sample This is a debug message +0ms
  sample This is a debug message with a variable: variable +0ms
  sample This is a debug message with an object: { key: 'value' } +0ms
To see log messages, run the script with DEBUG=genai:sample
DEBUG=sample genaiscript run debug
```

## GenAIScript builtin logging

- all internal logging in GenAIScript is prefixed with `genai:`.

```sh
DEBUG=genai:* genaiscript run ...
```

- agent logging is prefixed with `agent:name`.

```sh
DEBUG=agent:* genaiscript run ...
```

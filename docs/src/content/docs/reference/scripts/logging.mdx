GenAIScript uses the [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) library for logging.
It is a very flexible and powerful logging library that allows you to enable or disable logging for specific namespaces.

## Add Logging to Your Script

You can use the `host.logger` to create a logger with a specific namespace.

```js 'host.logger("sample")'
const log = host.logger("sample")
```

- log away!

```js
log("This is a debug message")
log("This is a debug message with a variable: %s", "variable")
log("This is a debug message with an object: %o", { key: "value" })

console.log("To see log messages, run the script with DEBUG=genai:sample")
console.log("DEBUG=sample genaiscript run debug")
```

## Seeing the logs

By default, the logging is disabled. To turn it on,
you need to set the `DEBUG` environment variable to the namespace you want to enable.
For example, to enable logging for the `sample` namespace, you can run the script like this:

```bash
DEBUG=sample genaiscript run debug
```

And you will see the following output:

```txt
  sample This is a debug message +0ms
  sample This is a debug message with a variable: variable +0ms
  sample This is a debug message with an object: { key: 'value' } +0ms
To see log messages, run the script with DEBUG=genai:sample
DEBUG=sample genaiscript run debug
```

## GenAIScript builtin logging

- all internal logging in GenAIScript is prefixed with `genai:`.
- agent logging is prefixed with `agent:name`.

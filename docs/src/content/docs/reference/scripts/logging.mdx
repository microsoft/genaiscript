GenAIScript uses the [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) library for logging.
It is a very flexible and powerful logging library that allows you to enable or disable logging for specific namespaces.

## Script logger

The `env.dbg` is a debug logger with `script` as the namespace.
Debug logger messages are _not_ sent to the markdown trace.

```js title="poem.genai.mjs"
// put this at the top of your script
// so you can use `dbg` throughout the file
const { dbg } = env

dgb("This is a debug message!")
```

## Seeing the logs

By default, the debug logging is disabled. You need to turn it on with namespace patterns.

The script messages are visible by running with `DEBUG=<scriptid>`.

```sh "--dbg script"
genascript run poem --dbg script
```

or using the `DEBUG` environment variable.

```sh
DEBUG=script genaiscript run ...
```

You can specify multiple categories by separating them with a comma.

```sh "--dbg script"
genascript run poem --dbg script file config modelalias
```

or

```sh
DEBUG=script,genaiscript:* genaiscript run ...
```

The `*` character may be used as a wildcard. Suppose for example your library has debuggers named `connect:bodyParser`,
`connect:compress`, `connect:session`, instead of listing all three with
`DEBUG=connect:bodyParser,connect:compress,connect:session`, you may simply do `DEBUG=connect:*`,
or to run everything using this module simply use `DEBUG=*`.

You can also exclude specific debuggers by prefixing them with a `-` character.
For example, `DEBUG=*,-connect:*` would include all debuggers except those starting with `connect:`.

### Visual Studio Code

Open the GenAIScript script settings and enable "Diagnostics" (same as setting '\*' as namespace)
or specifically set the **DEBUG** setting to the namespace you want to enable.

```sh
DEBUG=script
```

The default value is `script`.

### Command line

To turn loggin with the [cli](/genaiscript/reference/cli),
you need to set the `DEBUG` environment variable to the namespace you want to enable.
For example, to enable logging for the `sample` namespace, you can run the script like this:

```bash
DEBUG=script genaiscript run poem
```

And you will see the following output:

```txt
  sample This is a debug message +0ms
  sample This is a debug message with a variable: variable +0ms
  sample This is a debug message with an object: { key: 'value' } +0ms
To see log messages, run the script with DEBUG=genai:sample
DEBUG=sample genaiscript run debug
```

## Custom loggers

You can use the `host.logger` to create a custom logger with a specific namespace.

```js 'host.logger("sample")'
const d = host.logger("sample")

d("This is a debug message")
d("This is a debug message with a variable: %s", "variable")
d("This is a debug message with an object: %o", { key: "value" })

console.log("To see log messages, run the script with DEBUG=genai:sample")
console.log("DEBUG=sample genaiscript run debug")
```

and update the value of the `DEBUG` environment variable to the namespace you want to enable.

```sh
DEBUG=sample genaiscript run debug
```

## GenAIScript builtin logging

- all internal logging in GenAIScript is prefixed with `genaiscript:`.

```sh
DEBUG=genaiscript:* genaiscript run ...
```

- agent logging is prefixed with `agent:name`.

```sh
DEBUG=genaiscript:* genaiscript run ...
```

## OpenTelemetry

:::caution

OpenTelemetry is still under development.

:::

Using the `--telemetry` flag, you can enable OpenTelemetry tracing for your script.
GenAIScript will configure a [otlp-over-http trace exporter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http) at the standard endpoint,
and send all enabled logging messages to the OpenTelemetry collector.

```sh "--telemetry"
DEBUG=* genaiscript run poem --telemetry
```

You can configure the OpenTelemetry endpoint by setting the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable
(see [full documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opentelemetry/exporter-logs-otlp-http)).

```sh title=".env"
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TIMEOUT=10000
```

If you want to try out the telemetry locally, launch a [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) instance with Docker
and navigate to `http://localhost:16686` to see the traces.

```sh wrap
docker run -d --name jaeger -e COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED=true -p 16686:16686 -p 4317:4317 -p 4318:4318 jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest
```

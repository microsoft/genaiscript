[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) is an emerging standard
for portable tool definitions.

The MCP defines a protocol that allows to share [tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools)
and consume them regardless of the underlying framework/runtime.

**GenAIScript implements a server that turns scripts into MCP tools**.

:::tip

GenAIScript also implements a client for MCP tools which allows you to consume MCP tools in script.
See [MCP tools](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/mcp-tools) for more details.

## Scripts as MCP Tools

GenAIScript launches a MCP server that exposes each GenAIScript script as a MCP tool (not to be confused with `defTool`).

The MCP tool parameters is inferred from the [script parameters](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/parameters) and files automatically.
The MCP parameters will then populate the `env.vars` object in the script
as usual.

The MCP tool output is the script output. That is, typically, the last assistant message for a script that uses the top-level context.
Or any content that was passed in [env.output](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/output-builder).

Let's see an example. Here is a script `task.genai.mjs` that takes a `task` parameter input, builds a prompt
and the LLM output is sent back.

```js title="task.genai.mjs"
script({
    parameters: {
        task: {
            type: "string",
            description: "The task to perform",
            required: true
        }
    }
})

const { task } = env.vars // extract the task parameter

... // genaiscript logic
$`... prompt ... ${task}` // output the result
```

A more advanced script might not use the top-level context and instead use the `env.output` to pass the result.

```js title="task.genai.mjs"
script({
    accept: "none", // this script does not use 'env.files'
    parameters: {
        task: {
            type: "string",
            description: "The task to perform",
            required: true
        }
    }
})

const { output } = env // store the output builder
const { task } = env.vars // extract the task parameter

... // genaiscript logic with inline prompts
const res = runPrompt(_ => `... prompt ... ${task}`) // run some inner the prompt
...

// build the output
output.fence(`The result is ${res.text}`)
```

## Usage

The `mcp` command lanches the MCP server using the stdio transport.

- [@modelcontextprotocol/inspector](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@modelcontextprotocol/inspector)
  is a MCP client that can be used to inspect the server and list the available tools.

```sh
npx --yes @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx --yes genaiscript mcp
```

        }

}

:::note

MCP support is not yet available in the stable version of Visual Studio Code.
It is changing and things might not work as expected.

```json title=".vscode/mcp.json"
{
    "servers": {
        "genaiscript": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "node",
            "args": [
                "npx",
                "-y",
                "genaiscript",
                "mcp",
                "--cwd",
                "${workspaceFolder}",
                "--groups",
                "mcp"
            ],
            "envFile": "${workspaceFolder}/.env"
        }
    }
}
```

## Running scripts from a remote repository

You can use the `--remote` option to load scripts from a remote repository.
GenAIScript will do a shallow clone of the repository and run the script from the clone folder.

```sh
npx --yes genaiscript mcp --remote https://github.com/...
```

There are additional flags to how the repository is cloned:

- `--remote-branch <branch>`: The branch to clone from the remote repository.
- `--remote-force`: Force the clone even if the cloned folder already exists.
- `--remote-install`: Install dependencies after cloning the repository.

:::caution

As usual, be careful when running scripts from a remote repository.
Make sure you trust the source before running the script and consider locking to a specific commit.

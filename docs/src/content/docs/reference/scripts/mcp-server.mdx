[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) is an emerging standard
for portable tool definitions.

The MCP defines a protocol that allows to share [tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools)
and consume them regardless of the underlying framework/runtime.

**GenAIScript implements a server that turns scripts into MCP tools**.

:::tip

GenAIScript also implements a client for MCP tools which allows you to consume MCP tools in script.
See [MCP tools](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/mcp-tools) for more details.

:::

## Scripts as MCP Tools

GenAIScript launches a MCP server that exposes each GenAIScript script as a MCP tool (not to be confused with `defTool`).

The MCP tool parameters is inferred from the [script parameters](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/parameters) and files automatically.
The MCP parameters will then populate the `env.vars` object in the script
as usual.

The MCP tool output is the script output. That is, typically, the last assistant message for a script that uses the top-level context.
Or any content that was passed in [env.output](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/output-builder).

Let's see an example. Here is a script `task.genai.mjs` that takes a `task` parameter input, builds a prompt
and the LLM output is sent back.

```js title="task.genai.mjs"
script({
    parameters: {
        task: {
            type: "string",
            description: "The task to perform",
            required: true
        }
    }
})

const { task } = env.vars // extract the task parameter

... // genaiscript logic
$`... prompt ... ${task}` // output the result
```

A more advanced script might not use the top-level context and instead use the `env.output` to pass the result.

```js title="task.genai.mjs"
script({
    accept: "none", // this script does not use 'env.files'
    parameters: {
        task: {
            type: "string",
            description: "The task to perform",
            required: true
        }
    }
})

const { output } = env // store the output builder
const { task } = env.vars // extract the task parameter

... // genaiscript logic with inline prompts
const res = runPrompt(_ => `... prompt ... ${task}`) // run some inner the prompt
...

// build the output
output.fence(`The result is ${res.text}`)
```

## Resources

[Resources](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/resources)
are a core primitive in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that allow servers to expose data
and content that can be read by clients and used as context for LLM interactions.

In GenAScript, you can create a resource using `host.publishResource` and
it will automatically be exposed as a MCP resource.

```js title="task.genai.mjs"
const id = await host.publishResource("important data", file)
```

The return value is the resource uri which can be used in the prompt output.
`publishResource` supports files, buffers and strings.

The resource will be available for the lifetime of the MCP server.

### Secret scanning

GenAIScript has a built-in [secret scanning feature](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/secret-scanning)
that will scan your resources for secrets. To turn off the secret scanning feature,
you can set the `secretScanning` option to `false` in `publishResource`.

```js
const id = await host.publishResource("important data", file, {
    secretScanning: false,
})
```

## Startup script

You can specify a startup script id in the command line using the `--startup` option.
It will run after the server is started.

```sh
genaiscript mcp --startup load-resources
```

You can use this script to load resources or do any other setup you need.

## IDE configuration

The `mcp` command lanches the MCP server using the stdio transport.

- [@modelcontextprotocol/inspector](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@modelcontextprotocol/inspector)
  is a MCP client that can be used to inspect the server and list the available tools.

```sh
npx --yes @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx --yes genaiscript mcp
```

:::note

MCP support is not yet available in the stable version of Visual Studio Code.
It is changing and things might not work as expected.

```json title=".vscode/mcp.json"
{
    "servers": {
        "genaiscript": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "node",
            "args": [
                "npx",
                "-y",
                "genaiscript",
                "mcp",
                "--cwd",
                "${workspaceFolder}",
                "--groups",
                "mcp"
            ],
            "envFile": "${workspaceFolder}/.env"
        }
    }
}
```

## Running scripts from a remote repository

You can use the `--remote` option to load scripts from a remote repository.
GenAIScript will do a shallow clone of the repository and run the script from the clone folder.

```sh
npx --yes genaiscript mcp --remote https://github.com/...
```

There are additional flags to how the repository is cloned:

- `--remote-branch <branch>`: The branch to clone from the remote repository.
- `--remote-force`: Force the clone even if the cloned folder already exists.
- `--remote-install`: Install dependencies after cloning the repository.

:::caution

As usual, be careful when running scripts from a remote repository.
Make sure you trust the source before running the script and consider locking to a specific commit.

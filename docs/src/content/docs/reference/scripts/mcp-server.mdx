The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) defines a protocol that allows to share [tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools)
and consume them regardless of the underlying framework/runtime.

**GenAIScript implements a server that turns scripts into MCP tools**.

:::tip

GenAIScript also implements a client for MCP tools which allows you to consume MCP tools in script.
See [MCP tools](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/mcp-tools) for more details.

:::

## Scripts as MCP Tools

GenAIScript launches a MCP server that exposes each GenAIScript script as a MCP tool (not to be confused with `defTool`).

The MCP tool description is the script description.
**Make sure to carefully craft the description** as it is how the LLM decides
which tool to use when running a script. If your tool does not get picked up by the LLM, it's probably a description issue.

The MCP tool parameters is inferred from the [script parameters](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/parameters) and files automatically.
The MCP parameters will then populate the `env.vars` object in the script
as usual.

The MCP tool output is the script output. That is, typically, the last assistant message for a script that uses the top-level context.
Or any content that was passed in [env.output](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/output-builder).

Let's see an example. Here is a script `task.genai.mjs` that takes a `task` parameter input, builds a prompt
and the LLM output is sent back.

```js title="task.genai.mjs"
script({
    description: "You MUST provide a description!",
    parameters: {
        task: {
            type: "string",
            description: "The task to perform",
            required: true
        }
    }
})

const { task } = env.vars // extract the task parameter

... // genaiscript logic
$`... prompt ... ${task}` // output the result
```

A more advanced script might not use the top-level context and instead use the `env.output` to pass the result.

```js title="task.genai.mjs"
script({
    description: "You MUST provide a description!",
    accept: "none", // this script does not use 'env.files'
    parameters: {
        task: {
            type: "string",
            description: "The task to perform",
            required: true
        }
    }
})

const { output } = env // store the output builder
const { task } = env.vars // extract the task parameter

... // genaiscript logic with inline prompts
const res = runPrompt(_ => `... prompt ... ${task}`) // run some inner the prompt
...

// build the output
output.fence(`The result is ${res.text}`)
```

### Annotations

[Tool annotations](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools#tool-annotations) provide additional metadata about a tool’s behavior,
helping clients understand how to present and manage tools.
These annotations are hints that describe the nature and impact of a tool, but should not be relied upon for security decisions.

```js "annotations"
script({
    ...,
    annotations: {
        readOnlyHint: true,
        openWorldHint: true,
    },
})
```

- `title` is populated from the script title.
- `readOnlyHint`: `boolean`, default: `false`  
   If true, indicates the tool does not modify its environment.
- `destructiveHint`: `boolean`, default: `true`  
   If true, the tool may perform destructive updates (only meaningful when `readOnlyHint` is false).
- `idempotentHint`: `boolean`, default: `false`  
   If true, calling the tool repeatedly with the same arguments has no additional effect (only meaningful when `readOnlyHint` is false).
- `openWorldHint`: `boolean`, default: `true`  
   If true, the tool may interact with an “open world” of external entities.

## Resources

[Resources](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/resources)
are a core primitive in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that allow servers to expose data
and content that can be read by clients and used as context for LLM interactions.

In GenAScript, you can create a resource using `host.publishResource` and
it will automatically be exposed as a MCP resource.

```js title="task.genai.mjs"
const id = await host.publishResource("important data", file)
```

The return value is the resource uri which can be used in the prompt output.
`publishResource` supports files, buffers and strings.

The resource will be available for the lifetime of the MCP server.

### Secret scanning

GenAIScript has a built-in [secret scanning feature](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/secret-scanning)
that will scan your resources for secrets. To turn off the secret scanning feature,
you can set the `secretScanning` option to `false` in `publishResource`.

```js
const id = await host.publishResource("important data", file, {
    secretScanning: false,
})
```

## Startup script

You can specify a startup script id in the command line using the `--startup` option.
It will run after the server is started.

```sh
genaiscript mcp --startup load-resources
```

You can use this script to load resources or do any other setup you need.

## IDE configuration

The `mcp` command launches the MCP server using the stdio transport.

- [@modelcontextprotocol/inspector](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@modelcontextprotocol/inspector)
  is a MCP client that can be used to inspect the server and list the available tools.

```sh
npx --yes @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx --yes genaiscript mcp
```

### Visual Studio Code Insiders with GitHub Copilot Chat

You will need Visual Studio Code v1.99 or higher and the [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat) extension installed.

```json title=".vscode/mcp.json"
{
    "servers": {
        "genaiscript": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "genaiscript", "mcp", "--cwd", "${workspaceFolder}"],
            "envFile": "${workspaceFolder}/.env"
        }
    }
}
```

### Claude Desktop

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "genaiscript": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "genaiscript", "mcp"]
        }
    }
}
```

### Filtering scripts

If you need to filter out which scripts are exposed as MCP tools, you can use the `--groups` flag and
set the `mcp` group in your scripts.

```js 'group: "mcp"'
script({
    group: "mcp",
})
```

```json title=".vscode/mcp.json" ', "--groups", "mcp"'
{
    "servers": {
        "genaiscript": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "npx",
            "args": [
                "-y",
                "genaiscript",
                "mcp",
                "--cwd",
                "${workspaceFolder}",
                "--groups",
                "mcp"
            ],
            "envFile": "${workspaceFolder}/.env"
        }
    }
}
```

## Running scripts from a remote repository

You can use the `--remote` option to load scripts from a remote repository.
GenAIScript will do a shallow clone of the repository and run the script from the clone folder.

```sh
npx --yes genaiscript mcp --remote https://github.com/...
```

There are additional flags to how the repository is cloned:

- `--remote-branch <branch>`: The branch to clone from the remote repository.
- `--remote-force`: Force the clone even if the cloned folder already exists.
- `--remote-install`: Install dependencies after cloning the repository.

:::caution

As usual, be careful when running scripts from a remote repository.
Make sure you trust the source before running the script and consider locking to a specific commit.

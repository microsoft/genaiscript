LLM red teaming is a way to find vulnerabilities in AI systems before they're deployed by using simulated adversarial inputs.
GenAIScript provides a builtin support for [PromptFoo Red Team](https://www.promptfoo.dev/docs/red-team/).

## Adding Red Teaming to scripts

Add `redteam` to the `script` function to enable red teaming.

```js
script({
    redteam: {
        purpose: "You are a malicious user.",
    },
})
def("FILE", env.files)
$`Extract keywords from <FILE>`
```

The `purpose` property is used to guide the attack generation process. It should be as clear and specific as possible.
Include the following information:

- Who the user is and their relationship to the company
- What data the user has access to
- What data the user does not have access to
- What actions the user can perform
- What actions the user cannot perform
- What systems the agent has access to

## Plugins

[Plugins](https://www.promptfoo.dev/docs/red-team/plugins/) are Promptfoo's modular system for testing a variety of risks and vulnerabilities in LLM models and LLM-powered applications.
If not specified, GenAIScript will let PromptFoo use the `default` set of plugins.

This example loads the [OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model](https://www.promptfoo.dev/docs/red-team/owasp-llm-top-10/) plugins.

```js
script({
    redteam: {
        plugins: "owasp:llm",
    },
})
```

## Strategies

[Strategies](https://www.promptfoo.dev/docs/red-team/strategies/) are attack techniques that systematically probe LLM applications for vulnerabilities.
While plugins generate adversarial inputs, strategies determine how these inputs are delivered to maximize attack success rates.

## Configuration

There are limitations in which provider is supported to run the Red Team process (which requires LLM access).

- The grader requires OpenAI or Azure OpenAI provider.
- By default, the [remote generation](https://www.promptfoo.dev/docs/red-team/configuration/#remote-generation) is disabled (using the `PROMPTFOO_DISABLE_REDTEAM_REMOTE_GENERATION` variable).
  If you need to run with this service enable, using the `promptfoo` cli with the generated redteam configuration file.

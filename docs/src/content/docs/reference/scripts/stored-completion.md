Metadata is a map of key-value pairs used to enable stored completionsâ€”a feature in OpenAI and Azure OpenAI that allows you to store and retrieve completions for a given prompt. This is useful for distillation and evaluation purposes.

```js
script({
    metadata: {
        name: "my_script",
    },
})
```

You can attach up to 16 key-value pairs to an object. This is useful for storing additional information in a structured format and for querying objects via the API or dashboard.

Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with a maximum length of 512 characters.

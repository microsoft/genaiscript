[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) is an emerging standard
for portable tool definitions.

The MCP defines a protocol that allows to share [tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools)
and consume them regardless of the underlying framework/runtime.

**GenAIScript implements a client for MCP tools**.

:::tip

GenAIScript also implements a server for MCP which exposes any script as a tool.
See [MCP server](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/mcp-server) for more details.

## Configuring servers

You can configure servers using `defTool`, load their tool through the `system.mcp` system prompt,
or even wrap them with an agent using `system.agent_mcp`.

### `defTool`

You can use [defTool](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/tools) to declare a set of server configurations,
using the same syntax as in the [Claude configuration file](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers?tab=readme-ov-file#using-an-mcp-client).

```js
defTool({
    memory: {
        command: "npx",
        args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"],
    },
    filesystem: {
        command: "npx",
        args: [
            "-y",
            "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
            path.resolve("."),
        ],
    },
})
```

GenAIScript will launch the server and register all the tools listed by the server.
The tool identifier will be `server_toolname` to avoid clashes.

:::tip

If your tool has a name that is not a valid identifier,
you can use the `["tool-name"]` syntax.

```js '["server-memory"]
defTool({
    ["server-memory"]: {
        ...
    },
})
```

### `system.mcp`

The [system.mcp](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/system#system-mcp) system prompt loads the tools from a MCP server into the current script.
The script initialization takes the same parameters, with the addition of `id` parameters. The system script supports a single MCP server at a time.

```js
script({
    system: [
        {
            id: "system.mcp",
            parameters: {
                id: "playwright",
                command: "npx",
                args: ["--yes", "@playwright/mcp@latest", "--headless"],
            },
        },
    ],
})
```

### `system.agent_mcp`

The [system.agent_mcp](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/system#systemagent_mcp)
system prompt wraps the MCP server with an [agent](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/agents).

The `system.agent_mcp` system prompt takes the same parameters as `system.mcp`,
but also adds a `description` and optional `instructions` parameter.

```js
    system: [
        {
            id: "system.agent_mcp",
            parameters: {
                id: "playwright",
                description:
                    "An agent that uses playwright to run browser commands.",
                command: "npx",
                args: ["--yes", "@playwright/mcp@latest", "--headless"],
                instructions:
                    "Use the playwright tools as the Browser Automation Tools.",
            },
        },
    ],
```

:::tip

The `system.agent-mcp` allows you to load multiple MCP servers without overloading the LLM with too many tools.

## Lifecycle of servers

Servers are started when rendering the prompt and stopped once the chat session is completed.

This means that if you define servers in an [inline prompt](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/inline-prompts),
the server will be started/stopped for each inline prompt.

## Finding servers

The list of available servers can be found in the [Model Context Protocol Servers project](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers).

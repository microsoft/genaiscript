While most LLMs do not support videos natively, they can be integrated in scripts by rendering frames
and adding them as images to the prompt. This can be tedious and GenAIScript provides efficient helpers
to streamline this process.

## Configuration

The functionalities to render and analyze videos rely on [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)
and [ffprobe](https://ffmpeg.org/ffprobe.html).

On Linux, you can try

```sh
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

Make sure these tools are installed locally and available in your PATH,
or configure the `FFMPEG_PATH` / `FFPROBE_PATH` environment variables to point to the `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` executable.

### ffmpeg output caching

Since video processing can be slow, GenAIScript caches the results in subfolders under `.genaiscript/videos/...`
where the subfolder name is a hash from the video file content and the options used to render the video.
This way, you can re-run the script without having to re-render the video.

You can review the `ffmpeg` console log in the `log.txt` file in the cache folder.

## Extracting frames

As mentionned above, multi-modal LLMs typically support images as a sequence
of frames (or screenshots).

The `parsers.videoFrames` will render frames from a video file or url
and return them as an array of file paths. You can use the result with `defImages` directly.

```js
const frames = await parsers.videoFrames("path_url_to_video")
def("FRAMES", frames)
```

- specify a number of frames using `count`

```js "count: 10"
const frames = await parsers.videoFrames("...", { count: 10 })
```

- specify timestamps in seconds or percentages of the video duration using `timestamps` (or `times`)

```js "timestamps"
const frames = await parsers.videoFrames("...", { timestamps: ["0%", "50%"] })
```

- specify the transcript computed by the [transcribe](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/transcription) function. GenAIScript
  will extract a frame at the start of each segment.

```js "timestamps"
const transcript = await transcribe("...")
const frames = await parsers.videoFrames("...", { transcript })
```

## Extracting audio

The `parsers.videoAudio` will extract the audio from a video file or url
as a `.wav` file.

```js
const audio = await parsers.videoAudio("path_url_to_video")
```

The conversion to audio happens automatically
for videos when using [transcribe](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/transcription).

## Probing videos

You can extract metadata from a video file or url using `parsers.videoProbe`.

```js
const info = await parsers.videoProbe("path_url_to_video")
const { duration } = info.streams[0]
console.log(`video duration: ${duration} seconds`)
```

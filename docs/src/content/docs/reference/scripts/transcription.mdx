    alt: A simple 8-bit style graphic features a blocky computer monitor displaying
      an audio waveform. Nearby, a video file icon transitions into an audio
      file icon, indicated by an arrow between them. There is also a symbol for
      SRT subtitles and a small settings gear, all created with flat geometric
      shapes using five colors against a blank background. There are no people
      or text in the image, and the size is 128 by 128 pixels.

GenAIScript supports transcription and translations from OpenAI like APIs.

```js "transcribe"
const { text } = await transcribe("video.mp4")
```

## Configuration

The transcription API will automatically use [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)
to convert videos to audio files ([opus codec in a ogg container](https://community.openai.com/t/whisper-api-increase-file-limit-25-mb/566754)).

You need to install ffmpeg on your system. If the `FFMPEG_PATH` environment variable is set,
GenAIScript will use it as the full path to the ffmpeg executable.
Otherwise, it will attempt to call ffmpeg directly
(so it should be in your PATH).

## model

By default, the API uses the `transcription` [model alias](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/model-aliases) to transcribe the audio.
You can also specify a different model alias using the `model` option.

```js "openai:whisper-1" wrap
const { text } = await transcribe("...", { model: "openai:whisper-1" })
```

:::tip

You can use [Whisper ASR Webservice](/genaiscript/getting-started/configuration/#whisperasr) to run Whisper locally
or in a docker container.

## Segments

For models that support it, you can retreive the individual segments.

```js "{ segments }"
const { segments } = await transcribe("...")
for (const segment of segments) {
    const { start, text } = segment
    console.log(`[${start}] ${text}`)
}
```

## SRT and VTT

GenAIScript renders the segments to [SRT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip)
and [WebVTT](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVTT_API) formats as well.

```js
const { srt, vtt } = await transcribe("...")
```

## Translation

Some models also support transcribing and translating to English in one pass. For this case,
set the `translate: true` flag.

```js "translate: true"
const { srt } = await transcribe("...", { translate: true })
```

## Cache

You can cache the transcription results by setting the `cache` option to `true` (or a custom name).

```js "cache: true"
const { srt } = await transcribe("...", { cache: true })
```

or a custom salt

```js
const { srt } = await transcribe("...", { cache: "whisper" })
```

## VTT, SRT parsers

You can parse VTT and SRT files using the `parsers.transcription` function.

```js
const segments = parsers.transcription("WEBVTT...")
```

The GenAISCript Markdown Notebook is currently used to author the GenAIScript documentation. 

It allows to run script snippets and inline the result in the markdown just like this:

```js
$`Write a 3 emoji story.`
```

./file1.py.
```

File /path_to_file/file2.md:
`````markdown

## Page Configuration

You can provide global configuration settings in the front matter. The front matter starts and ends with three dashes `---` and is located at the top of the markdown file.

```md
---
title: My genai notebook
genaiscript:
  model: openai:gpt-3.5-turbo
  ...
---
```

### Model, temperature, ...

You can specify the LLM configuration metadata from `script`.

```markdown
---
genaiscript:
   model: openai:gpt-3.5-turbo
   temperature: 0
---
```

### Files

You can specify the files to include in the notebook, as a single entry or an array. Globs are supported. 
The files are relative to the workspace root.

```md
---
genaiscript:
  files: src/samples/*.md
---
```

The `env.files` variable is available to reference the files in the notebook.

```js
def("FILE", env.files)
$`Summarize FILE using exclusively emojis.`
```

What is Markdown?
 Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world‚Äôs most popular markup languages. 

Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn‚Äôt like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.

For example, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., **this text is bold**). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you‚Äôre accustomed to WYSIWYG applications. The screenshot below shows a Markdown file displayed in the Visual Studio Code text editor....

üìù Markdown is a lightweight markup language created by John Gruber in 2004. It allows you to format plaintext documents using simple syntax. Unlike WYSIWYG editors, Markdown requires you to add specific symbols to indicate formatting, such as using # for headings and ** for bold text. It may take some time to adjust to this syntax if you're used to WYSIWYG applications.

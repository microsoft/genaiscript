You can specify a list of preferred words (choices) in the script metadata. It will increase the probability of the model generating the specified words.

- Each word should match a single token for the desired model!
- For some models, GenAIScript does not have a token encoder so it won't be able to compute the logit bias for the choices

```js
script({
    choices: ["OK", "ERR"],
})
...
```

```text
ERR
```

## Custom weights

You can tune the probability of each choice by providing a weight for each choice.
The default weight is `5`.

```js '{ token: "ERR", weight: 10 }'
script({
    choices: ["OK", { token: "ERR", weight: 10 }],
})
```

## Pre-encoded tokens

For models where GenAIScript does not have a token encoder, you can provide the pre-encoded tokens.

```js
script({
    choices: [{ token: 12345, weight: 10 }],
})
```

## Logit Bias

Internally, GenAIScript tokenizes the word and build the [logit_bias](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5247780-using-logit-bias-to-alter-token-probability-with-the-openai-api) for each token.

- choices: `OK`, `ERR`
- logit bias: `{"5175":5,"5392":5}`

## Logprobs

You can enable [logprobs](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/logprobs) to visualize the confidence of the tokens generated by the model.

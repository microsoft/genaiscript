[Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/) is a distribution of Python for Node.js (and the browser).

Pyodide is a port of CPython to WebAssembly/Emscripten.
Pyodide makes it possible to install and run Python packages in the browser with [micropip](https://micropip.pyodide.org/en/stable/project/usage.html).

GenAIScript provides a convinience layer to start pyodide python runtimes.

## Usage

The `host.python` starts an instance of Pyodide.

```js wrap
const py = await host.python()
```

Each Pyodide instance has a `run` method that can be used to run Python code.

```js wrap
const result = await py.run(`print('Hello, World!')`)
```

## Globals

You can read and write global variables in the Pyodide environment.

```js wrap
py.globals.set("x", 42)
const x = py.globals.get("x")
await py.run(`print(x)`)
```

## Workspace file system

The current workspace file system is mounted on the `/workspace` directory in the Pyodide environment.

```js wrap
const result = await runtime.run(`
import os
os.listdir('/workspace')
`)
console.log({ result })
```

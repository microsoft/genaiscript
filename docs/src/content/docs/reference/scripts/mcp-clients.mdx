GenAIScript provides that ability to start and interact programmatically with a MCP server.
Typically, this is reserved for the LLM orchestration, but it can be useful to use JavaScript to do a few calls to Servers
before making a request.

This is a thin layer above the MCP TypeScript SDK.

## Starting a server

You start a server with the same syntax as mcp configuration files, but you need to provide an identifier for the server.
This identifier is used to identify the server in the mcpClient.

```js
const fs = await host.mcpServer({
    id: "filesystem",
    command: "npx",
    args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", path.resolve(".")],
})
```

The server is automatically stopped when the prompt is finished.

## Tools

You can do operations on tools. The queries are not cached and always communicate with the server.

- list tools

```js
const tools = await fs.listTools()
```

- call a tool

```js
const res = await fs.callTool("get_file_info", { path: "README.md" })
```

- use result

```js
const info = res.content[0].text
```

The structure of the output depends on the tool but it was meant to be consumed by an LLM so probably you
will want to use `def` to store it in your prompt.

```js
def("INFO", info)
```

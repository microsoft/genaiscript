    alt: A simple, flat 2D illustration depicts an open package box with basic
      digital script symbols, small code blocks, and algorithm icons rising from
      it. Stylized arrows represent data flow around the box. The art uses five
      solid corporate colors in an 8-bit, geometric, pixelated style. The image
      is 128x128 pixels, transparent background, no text, no people, and no
      shading.

The GenAIScript [cli](/genaiscript/reference/cli) also contains
a set of helpers written in GenAIScript. They can be imported
as the `genaiscript/runtime` module.

In order to use the runtime, you will need to install GenAIScript
in your project.

<PackageManagers pkg="genaiscript" dev />

## Helpers

- [cast](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/cast), cast any data to structured outputs
- [classify](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/classify), classify text
- [makeItBetter](/genaiscript/guides/make-it-better), tell the LLM to improve its result
- [pipeline](/genaiscript/guides/transformers-js), access to HuggingFace transformers

## Importing the runtime

The runtime is available as a module. You can import it
using the following code:

```js
import { cast } from "genaiscript/runtime"
```

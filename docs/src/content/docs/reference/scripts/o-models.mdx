The OpenAI reasoning models, the `o1, o3` models, are models that are optimized for reasoning tasks.

```js
script({
    model: "openai:o1",
})
```

- You can experiement with these models on Github Models as well but the context window is quite small.

```js
script({
    model: "github:o3-mini",
})
```

## Reasoning effort

The reasoning effort parameter can be set to `low`, `medium`, or `high`.

```js 'reasoningEffort: "high"'
script({
    model: "openai:o3-mini"
    reasoningEffort: "high"
})
```

## Limitations

- `o1-preview`, `o1-mini` do not support streaming
- `o1` models do not support tool calling so GenAIScript uses [fallback tools](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/tools).

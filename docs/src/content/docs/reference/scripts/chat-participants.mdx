The `defChatParticipant` allows to register a function that can add new user messages in the chat sequence.
This allows to create multi-turn chat, or to simulate a conversation with multiple participants.

```js
let turn = 0
defChatParticipant((_, messages) => {
    if (++turn === 1) _.$`Are you sure?`
})
```

In the example above, the `defChatParticipant` function is used to register a function that will be called every time a new message is added to the chat.

The function receives two arguments: the first argument is the `Chat` object, and the second argument is the list of messages that have been added to the chat since the last call to the function.

```js
defChatParticipant(async (_, messages) => {
  const text = messages.at(-1).content
  ...
})
```

## Tracking turns

The participant will be called on every turn so it is important to keep track of the turns to avoid infinite loops.

```js
let turn = 0
defChatParticipant((_, messages) => {
    if (++turn === 1) _.$`Are you sure?`
})
```


## Example: QA generator

This script uses a multi-turn chat to generate questions, answers and validate the quality of the answers.

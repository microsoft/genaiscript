The **Playground** is a self-hosted web application that allows you to run GenAIScript scripts
from a friendly user interface. It sits between the GenAIScript CLI
and the GenAIScript Visual Studio Code integration.

> The playground is still under construction.

## Launch

From your project workspace root, run

```sh
npx --yes genaiscript serve
```

then navigate to the URL printed on the console (typically `http://127.0.0.1:8003/`).

title: Web API Server
description: The Web API server exposes a REST API, OpenAPI compatible, to run scripts.
---

You can launch the [cli](/genaiscript/reference/cli) as a **Web API server** to serve scripts as REST endpoints.
The server is OpenAPI 3.1 compatible and uses [fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) under the hood.

```bash
genaiscript webapi
```

## Scripts as REST endpoints

The Web API server exposes scripts as REST endpoints. It uses the title, description, groups and tags
to generate a OpenAPI 3.1 specification and server using fastify.

The OpenAPI endpoint parameters is inferred from the [script parameters](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/parameters) and files automatically.
The OpenAPI parameters will then populate the `env.vars` object in the script
as usual.

The OpenAPI endpoint output is the script output. That is, typically, the last assistant message for a script that uses the top-level context.
The OpenAPI endpoint output corresponds to the script's output, typically the last assistant message or any content passed to [env.output](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/output-builder).

Let's see an example. Here is a script `task.genai.mjs` that takes a `task` parameter input, builds a prompt
and the LLM output is sent back.

```js title="task.genai.mjs"
script({
    description: "You MUST provide a description!",
    parameters: {
        task: {
            type: "string",
            description: "The task to perform",
            required: true
        }
    }
})

const { task } = env.vars // extract the task parameter

... // genaiscript logic
$`... prompt ... ${task}` // output the result
```

A more advanced script might not use the top-level context and instead use the `env.output` to pass the result.

```js title="task.genai.mjs"
script({
    description: "You should provide a description!",
    accept: "none", // this script does not use 'env.files'
    parameters: {
        task: {
            type: "string",
            description: "The task to perform",
            required: true
        }
    }
})

const { output } = env // store the output builder
const { task } = env.vars // extract the task parameter

... // genaiscript logic with inline prompts
const res = runPrompt(_ => `... prompt ... ${task}`) // run some inner the prompt
...

// build the output
output.fence(`The result is ${res.text}`)
```

## Route

The default route is `/api` and the OpenAPI specification is available at `/api/docs/json`.
You can change the route using the `--route` option.

```bash
genaiscript webapi --route /genai
```

The OpenAPI specification will be available at `/myapi/docs/json`.
You can also change the port using the `--port` option.

```bash
genaiscript webapi --route /genai --port 4000
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:4000/myapi`.

## Startup script

You can specify a startup script id in the command line using the `--startup` option.
It will run after the server is started.

```sh
genaiscript openapi --startup load-resources
```

You can use this script to load resources or do any other setup you need.

### Filtering scripts

If you need to filter out which scripts are exposed as OpenAPI endpoints, you can use the `--groups` flag and
set the `openapi` group in your scripts.

```js 'group: "openapi"' title="task.genai.mjs"
script({
    group: "openapi",
})
```

```bash
genaiscript openapi --groups openapi
```

## Running scripts from a remote repository

You can use the `--remote` option to load scripts from a remote repository.
GenAIScript will do a shallow clone of the repository and run the script from the clone folder.

```sh
npx --yes genaiscript openapi --remote https://github.com/...
```

There are additional flags to how the repository is cloned:

- `--remote-branch <branch>`: The branch to clone from the remote repository.
- `--remote-force`: Force the clone even if the cloned folder already exists.
- `--remote-install`: Install dependencies after cloning the repository.

:::caution

As usual, be careful when running scripts from a remote repository.
Make sure you trust the source before running the script and consider locking to a specific commit.

## Linting

You can run [spectral](https://github.com/stoplightio/spectral) to lint your OpenAPI specifications.

- save this `.spectral.yaml` file in the root of your project:

```yaml
extends: "spectral:oas"
```

- launch the api server
- run the spectral linter

```bash
npx --yes -p @stoplight/spectral-cli spectral lint http://localhost:3000/api/docs/json
```

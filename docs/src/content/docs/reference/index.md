    alt: "A circular arrangement of five 8-bit style icons on a plain background: a
      scroll with code brackets for scripting, a glowing AI brain chip for
      artificial intelligence, a simple gear for command line interface, a
      minimalist laptop with a magic wand symbolizing a VSCode extension, and a
      row of basic blocks illustrating workflow automation. Each icon uses only
      five distinct corporate colors and is rendered with flat, minimal
      geometric shapes."

GenAIScript is a scripting language that makes LLMs a first-class part of the scripting process, easily allowing users to author, debug, and deploy LLM-based scripts that can perform tasks beyond the reach of conventional code. This reference guide provides comprehensive documentation for GenAIScripts, including script syntax, LLM configurations, the VSCode extension, and the CLI.

- [Scripts](/genaiscript/reference/scripts) provide a domain-specific JavaScript framework to build LLM requests.
- [CLI](/genaiscript/reference/cli) documents the command-line interface to automate GenAIScripts executions.
- [Visual Studio Code Extension](/genaiscript/reference/vscode) provides a rich set of features to author, debug, and deploy GenAIScripts.

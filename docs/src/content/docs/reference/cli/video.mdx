    alt: A small, flat, geometric video player rectangle sits at the center, with
      four simple 8-bit icons—film strip, speaker, waveform, and
      clock—positioned near each corner. Each icon uses a solid color and basic
      shapes. The image has no background, text, or people, and uses only five
      corporate color tones in a minimal, retro 128x128 pixel style.

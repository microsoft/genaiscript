  image:
    alt: An 8-bit style computer terminal is depicted alongside a gear and network
      node icons, using a flat 2D geometric design with only five distinct
      colors. The image is small, at 128 by 128 pixels, and completely avoids
      people, text, shadows, gradients, reflections, backgrounds, or any
      three-dimensional effects. The composition suggests themes of computer
      configuration and network connectivity.

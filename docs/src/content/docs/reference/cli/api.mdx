This page describes how to import and use the [cli](/genaiscript/reference/cli) as an API in your Node.JS application.

Assuming you have have added the cli as a dependency in your project, you can import the cli as follows:

<PackageManagers pkg="genaiscript" dev />

The API can be imported using imports from **"genaiscript/api"**.

```js wrap
import { run } from "genaiscript/api"
```

The imported `api.mjs` wrapper is a tiny, zero dependency loader that
spawns a [Node.JS worker thread](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html) to run GenAIScript.

- No pollutation of the globals
- No side effects on the process

## `run`

The `run` function wraps the [cli run](/genaiscript/reference/cli/run) command.

```js wrap
import { run } from "genaiscript/api"

const results = await run("summarize", ["myfile.txt"])
```

### Environment variables

You can set the environment variables for the GenAIScript process by passing an object as the `env` field in the options. By default, the worker will inherit `process.env`.

```js wrap
const results = await run("summarize", ["myfile.txt"], {
    env: {
        MY_ENV_VAR: "value",
    },
})
```

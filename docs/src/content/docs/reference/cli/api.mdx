import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components"

This page describes how to import and use the [cli](/genaiscript/reference/cli) as an API in your Node.JS application.

Assuming you have have added the cli as a dependency in your project, you can import the cli as follows:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```sh
npm install -D genaiscript
```

</TabItem>

  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```sh
yarn add -D genaiscript
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

The API can be imported using imports (CommonJS is not supported) from **"genaiscript/api"**.

```javascript
import { runScript } from "genaiscript/api"
```

The imported API is a tiny-zero dependency wrapper that takes the arguments and spawns a [Node.JS worker thread](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html) to run GenAIScript.

- No pollutation of the globals
- No side effects on the process

## `run`

The `run` function wraps the [cli run](/genaiscript/reference/cli/run) command.

```javascript
import { run } from "genaiscript/api"

const { exitCode, results } = await run("summarize", ["myfile.txt"])
```

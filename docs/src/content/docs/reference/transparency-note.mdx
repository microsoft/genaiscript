## The Basics of GenAIScript

### Introduction

GenAIScript is a framework that empowers teams, including
non-developers, to create and use AI-enhanced scripts to support their
workflows. GenAIScript provides support for authoring and debugging
JavaScript scripts that incorporate calls to foundation models and LLMs [^1]
in their execution. GenAIScript is a programming framework that
allows its users to author AI scripts (which we call a GenAIScript),
debug those scripts in a development environment that is an extension of
VS Code, and package those scripts in a command-line interface that can
be deployed in many contexts.

Our VS Code extension supports easy authoring of a GenAIScript by
writing natural language in markdown syntax plus a small amount of
stylized JavaScript programming. Our framework allows users to leverage
multiple LLM models, parameterize the calls to the models, execute and
debug scripts, trace the construction of the LLM prompts and provide a
full trace of execution from prompt construction to LLM generation to
parsing the LLM result. Our framework also supports extracting multiple
forms of output from LLM generations, including output in files of
different types, outputs intended as edits to existing files and outputs
in structured formats, such as JSON.

### Key terms

**GenAIScript** A stylized JavaScript program that defines the context
for the LLM call, allows arbitrary JavaScript code execution, packages
the prompt input for the LLM, calls the LLM, and unpacks that LLM output
based on the directions given in the prompt.

**GPVM**: A runtime system that given a GenAIScript executes the GenAIScript, which involves integrating the context
into a prompt, calling the specified LLM, and extracting content from
the LLM result.

**VS Code GenAIScript extension** An add-in to VS Code that provides
users with easy methods for creating, editing, running and debugging
GenAIScript.

**Foundation models and LLMs** While GenAIScript currently supports
different LLMs, in the future we anticipate that we will incorporate
additional foundation models beyond large language models.

## Capabilities

### System behavior

GenAIScript is a general-purpose AI-script authoring framework for
seamlessly integrating code execution and foundation model/LLM
invocations. A GenAIScript is a JavaScript program in a stylized format
that allows users to easily specify the LLM context and prompt, invoked
a specified model, and parse the resulting output according to user
specifications. This functionality allows even users who are not
programmers to inspect model results and double check them for
correctness.

GenAIScript can be written in any IDE but the VS Code GenAIScript add-in
makes creating, executing and debugging GenAIScript especially easy.
GenAIScript users can implement tools that generate and edit multiple
files with a single tool and our integration with VS Code leverages
existing functionality in for refactoring to allow users to easily see
the results of the tool execution. The add-in supports creating a new
GenAIScript, invoking a given GenAIScript, tracing the execution of the GenAIScript in establishing the LLM
context and final prompt, and unparsing the LLM output into the
user-specified elements. Examples of all of these capabilities can be
viewed in the documents in the GenAIScript repository:
[microsoft/GenAIScript: Generative AI Scripting
(github.com)](https://microsoft.github.io/genaiscript/)

The goal of GenAIScript is to empower a broad range of potential users
to innovate with building AI-powered scripts and identify new ways to
leverage AI for their daily tasks. We expect that professional
developers, who are familiar with writing and using scripts to enhance
their productivity will be the early adopters of GenAIScript.
GenAIScript will give these users benefit because GenAIScript can do
many things that existing scripts written in traditional scripting
languages like JavaScript and Python cannot do. While developers can
leverage other frameworks, such as langchain and Semantic Kernel, that
integrate calls to LLMs into languages like Python, these
frameworks require more user effort and have less IDE support than
GenAIScript. Ultimately, because our goal is to make GenAIScript easy to
author, modify, debug and run, we anticipate that they will be useful
far beyond professional developers. A major impact of GenAIScript will
be to enable non-developers to innovate and build GenAIScripts that
enhance their productivity. We illustrate this point with examples
below.

### Documentation

To help users get started with GenAIScript, we include documentation in
our repository that illustrates in code snippets the contents of several
different GenAIScripts. The documentation shows both what the example
GenAIScript looks like as well as what the effect is from the
GenAIScript acting on a particular input. While these examples are
intended to explain the technology, they are not intended to be the
basis for user-written tools.

### Use cases

#### Intended uses

GenAIScript can be used in any context where a command line script
written in another programming language might be used but the use cases
are much more ambitious because the LLM can do much more than ordinary
code. Here are some examples:

-   **Checking for potential inconsistencies in a collection of configuration files or other content.** Using the LLM, a GenAIScript
    can inspect configuration files and leverage the LLM's understanding
    of common configuration errors to detect and report them. Before
    LLMs, professional developers would write tools, such as lint[^2],
    which are complex programs that detect inconsistencies in the syntax
    of their code files. With GenAIScript, checking tools can be written
    for much richer scenarios (such as checking for inappropriate
    variable names), and by individuals who are not professional
    developers.

-   **Automating document translation:** Given documentation in a
    repository written in one natural language, a GenAIScript can be
    written to translate that documentation into another language. For a
    specific example of why GenAIScript is important for this use,
    consider the task of maintaining the localization of the
    MakeCode[^3] documentation. MakeCode documentation has nearly 2M
    files, which are typically markdown with a mix of code snippets.
    Many documents are partially translated (at the paragraph level). To check the correctness of
    document translations, there are
    3500 registered volunteer translators for 35+ languages. One cannot
    just apply Bing translate for this use case, as it typically destroys the code
    snippets. With GenAIScript, we can have a script that goes through
    every documentation file, pulls the current localized version and
    assembles a prompt to ask the LLM to fill in the missing
    translations, while leaving the existing ones alone. Because the LLM model we use has already been trained on
    MakeCode examples and documentation it is aware of the syntax.

-   **Creating a short version of a longer white paper by summarizing each chapter.** LLMs are quite effective at summarizing documents. A
    GenAIScript can be written to take each chapter of a long document
    and summarize it in a section of a shorter document.

-   **Translating a monolog to a dialog.** Given a monolog from a video
    transcript, a GenAIScript can be written to rewrite the monolog into
    a dialog between two individuals (akin to sports announcers talking
    to each other) to make the video more interesting and accessible.

#### Unintended uses

GenAIScript is a general framework for authoring scripts. As a result,
an adversary can use GenAIScript to author adversarial scripts that
could be used for malicious purposes. All of the adversarial uses of
GenAIScript could also be implemented in other LLM language extension
frameworks such as Sematic Kernel, autogen, and langchain, so the danger
from unintended uses of GenAIScript stems from possibility that it might
make it easier to author adversarial scripts. This issue is present in
any infrastructure that makes programming easier, including languages
such as PowerShell, JavaScript, and Python, as well as IDEs such as VS
Code and Visual Studio. While we cannot prevent unintended uses, we will
encourage users to consider Responsible AI practices when they build
GenAIScripts. We provide more details about issues related to security and trust in [security and trust](https://microsoft.github.io/genaiscript/reference/security-and-trust/).

#### Foundation model best practices

We strongly encourage GenAIScript users to use foundation models and
LLMs that support robust Responsible AI mitigations, such as the Azure
Open AI (AOAI) services. Such services continually update the safety and
RAI mitigations to track our up-to-date understanding on how to deploy
and use foundation models most responsibly. Here are resources to help
understand and use best practices when employing foundations models
for scripts and applications:

-   [Transparency note for Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/transparency-note?tabs=text)
-   [Microsoft Office of Responsible AI (ORA) Best Practices on using AOAI models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/overview)

We recommand to review the [Content Safety](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/content-safety) documentation for more information on how to guard against harmful content and jailbreaking.

## Limitations

GenAIScript is an evolving framework that will improve based on input
from users. Existing limitations in the framework include integration into only one IDE
(VS code), and internal support for OpenAI APIs plus a relatively small
number of other LLMs. We intend to allow users to integrate calls to
external services (such as RAG) in GenAIScript to provide the LLM with
more context. We anticipate adding support for more foundation models as the use cases evolve.

We also anticipate that the on-ramp to using GenAIScript will evolve. We
have explored supporting invoking the GenAIScript framework as part of a VS
Code Copilot Chat experience (hosted in VS Code Insider's Edition). We also understand that some developers would prefer to
implement their GenAIScript using Python instead of JavaScript. We
anticipate building a Python binding form authoring GenAIScripts in the
future.

### Technical limitations, operational factors and ranges

GenAIScript does not use any AI model in executing the framework itself.
Individuals using GenAIScript to author their own AI scripts will be
subject to the technical limitations, operational factors, and ranges of
the AI LLM their script uses.

### Best practices for improving system performance

GenAIScript encourages users to consult the best practices for authoring
effective prompts for the specific LLM they are invoking in their tool.

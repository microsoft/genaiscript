title: OpenAPI Server
description: The OpenAPI Server exposes scripts as OpenAPI endpoints.

You can launch the [cli](/genaiscript/reference/cli) as a [OpenAPI server](https://swagger.io/specification/)
to serve scripts as OpenAPI endpoints.

```bash
genaiscript openapi
```

## Scripts as OpenAPI endpoints

The OpenAPI endpoint description is the script description.
**Make sure to carefully craft the description** as it is how the LLM decides
which tool to use when running a script. If your tool does not get picked up by the LLM, it's probably a description issue.

The OpenAPI endpoint parameters is inferred from the [script parameters](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/parameters) and files automatically.
The OpenAPI parameters will then populate the `env.vars` object in the script
as usual.

The OpenAPI endpoint output is the script output. That is, typically, the last assistant message for a script that uses the top-level context.
The OpenAPI endpoint output corresponds to the script's output, typically the last assistant message or any content passed to [env.output](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/output-builder).

Let's see an example. Here is a script `task.genai.mjs` that takes a `task` parameter input, builds a prompt
and the LLM output is sent back.

```js title="task.genai.mjs"
script({
    description: "You MUST provide a description!",
    parameters: {
        task: {
            type: "string",
            description: "The task to perform",
            required: true
        }
    }
})

const { task } = env.vars // extract the task parameter

... // genaiscript logic
$`... prompt ... ${task}` // output the result
```

A more advanced script might not use the top-level context and instead use the `env.output` to pass the result.

```js title="task.genai.mjs"
script({
    description: "You should provide a description!",
    accept: "none", // this script does not use 'env.files'
    parameters: {
        task: {
            type: "string",
            description: "The task to perform",
            required: true
        }
    }
})

const { output } = env // store the output builder
const { task } = env.vars // extract the task parameter

... // genaiscript logic with inline prompts
const res = runPrompt(_ => `... prompt ... ${task}`) // run some inner the prompt
...

// build the output
output.fence(`The result is ${res.text}`)
```

## Startup script

You can specify a startup script id in the command line using the `--startup` option.
It will run after the server is started.

```sh
genaiscript openapi --startup load-resources
```

You can use this script to load resources or do any other setup you need.

### Filtering scripts

If you need to filter out which scripts are exposed as OpenAPI endpoints, you can use the `--groups` flag and
set the `openapi` group in your scripts.

```js 'group: "openapi"' title="task.genai.mjs"
script({
    group: "openapi",
})
```

```bash
genaiscript openapi --groups openapi
```

## Running scripts from a remote repository

You can use the `--remote` option to load scripts from a remote repository.
GenAIScript will do a shallow clone of the repository and run the script from the clone folder.

```sh
npx --yes genaiscript openapi --remote https://github.com/...
```

There are additional flags to how the repository is cloned:

- `--remote-branch <branch>`: The branch to clone from the remote repository.
- `--remote-force`: Force the clone even if the cloned folder already exists.
- `--remote-install`: Install dependencies after cloning the repository.

:::caution

As usual, be careful when running scripts from a remote repository.
Make sure you trust the source before running the script and consider locking to a specific commit.

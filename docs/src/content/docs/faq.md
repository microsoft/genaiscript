### Getting Started

-   **What is GenAIScript and how does it work?**
    GenAIScript is a framework that allows users to create AI-enhanced scripts to automate tasks. It uses simple commands and integrates with AI models to execute tasks based on user-written prompts.

-   **Who can use GenAIScript and do I need to be a developer?**
    Anyone can use GenAIScript, including non-developers. It's designed to be user-friendly, but some basic understanding of scripting or programming can be helpful.

-   **What are the prerequisites for using GenAIScript?**
    You'll need to have VS Code installed to use the GenAIScript extension, and some familiarity with programming concepts is beneficial but not necessary.

-   **How do I install the GenAIScript framework and its VS Code extension?**
    The specific installation steps are documented here: [Installation](/genaiscript/getting-started/installation)

-   **Do I need to install Node.JS?**
    Some features like the Command Line or vector databases use Node.JS. To install it, follow the [installation instructions](/genaiscript/reference/cli/).

-   **Can I use GenAIScript in IDEs other than VS Code?**
    Currently, GenAIScript is integrated with VS Code, but it can be written in any IDE. The VS Code extension, however, provides additional support for creating and debugging scripts.

-   **What are foundation models and LLMs in the context of GenAIScript?**
    Foundation models and LLMs (Large Language Models) are AI models that GenAIScript can interact with to perform tasks like generating text or processing information.

-   **How do I write my first GenAIScript?**
    Start by learning the basics of JavaScript and the GenAIScript framework, then use the VS Code extension to create a script that defines the task, calls the LLM, and processes the output. More informatoin is available here: [Getting Started](/genaiscript/getting-started)

### Using GenAIScript

-   **How do I debug a GenAIScript in VS Code?**
    Use the GenAIScript extension in VS Code, which provides tools for running, debugging, and tracing the execution of your script. Directions for debugging are here: [Debugging](/genaiscript/getting-started/debugging-scripts)

-   **What are the best practices for authoring effective prompts in GenAIScript?**
    See [Best Practices](/genaiscript/getting-started/best-practices)

-   **How can I integrate calls to multiple LLM models within a single GenAIScript?**
    The framework allows you to parameterize calls to different models, so you can include multiple model invocations within your script and manage them accordingly using the runPrompt function documented here: [Inline Prompts](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/inline-prompts)

-   **Can GenAIScript generate outputs in formats other than JSON?**
    Yes, GenAIScript supports multiple output formats, including file edits, JSON, and user-defined schema. More information here: [Schemas](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/schemas)

-   **How do I execute a GenAIScript from the command line?**
    Once you have a GenAIScript packaged, you can run it from the command line like any other script. More information here: [Command Line](/genaiscript/getting-started/automating-scripts)

-   **Can GenAIScripts take input from files in multiple formats, such as .pdf or .docx?**
    Yes, the GenAIScript framework has built-in support for reading .pdf and .docx formats. See the documentation pages [PDF](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/pdf) and [DOCX](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/docx) for more information.

### Advanced Features

-   **How can I use GenAIScript to automate document translation?**
    One of our case studies illustrates the use of GenAIScript for translating document fragments between languages: [Translation Case Study](/genaiscript/case-studies/documentation-translations)

-   **Can I use GenAIScript to summarize documents or create dialogues from monologues?**
    Yes, LLMs are good at summarizing and can be used within GenAIScript to summarize documents or convert monologues into dialogues.

### Troubleshooting

-   **What should I do if I encounter errors while running a GenAIScript?**
    Check the error messages, consult the documentation, and use the debugging tools in the VS Code extension to identify and resolve issues.

-   **How can I troubleshoot issues with the LLM output parsing in GenAIScript?**
    Review the prompt and output, ensure your script correctly handles the LLM's response, and adjust your parsing logic as needed.

-   **Where can I find examples of GenAIScript to understand its capabilities better?**
    Visit the GenAIScript GitHub repository for examples and documentation. [GenAIScript Documentation](/genaiscript/)

### Security and Responsible AI

-   **What are the unintended uses of GenAIScript and how can I avoid them?**
    Unintended uses include any malicious applications. To avoid them, follow Responsible AI practices and use recommended models with safety features.

-   **How does GenAIScript align with Responsible AI practices?**
    GenAIScript encourages the use of models with robust Responsible AI mitigations and provides guidance on secure and ethical usage.
    For more information, see the [Transparency Note](/genaiscript/reference/transparency-note)

-   **What foundation models and LLMs are recommended for use with GenAIScript?**
    Services like Azure Open AI with updated safety and Responsible AI features are recommended. GenAIScript can also be used with existing open-source LLMs.

### Community and Support

-   **Where can I find the GenAIScript community for discussions and support?**
    The GenAIScript GitHub repository is a good place to start for community discussions and support. [GenAIScript GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/genaiscript/)

The following sample shows a script that analyzes a GitHub Action Workflow Job log and attempts to determine the root cause of the issue.

## Strategy

The script is a hybrid between traditional software and LLM/Agent based software. We start by collecting relevant information for the LLM, to fill the context with relevant information
then we let the agent reason and ask for more information as needed through tools.

## Add the script

- Open your GitHub repository and start a new pull request.
- Add the following script to your repository as `genaisrc/prr.genai.mts`.

<Code code={source} wrap={true} lang="ts" title="gai.genai.mts" />

<Code code={gasource} wrap={true} lang="yaml" title="gai.yml" />

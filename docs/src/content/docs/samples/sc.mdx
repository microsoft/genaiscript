Automating and improving the efficiency of proofreading documents is a common need among developers and writers. This script addresses this need by checking and correcting spelling and grammar in Markdown files.

## Code Explanation

Starting at the top of the script, we see that it's a GenAI script, which is evident from the `.mts` extension and the `script` function call.

```ts
script({
    title: "Spell checker",
    system: [
        "system.output_plaintext",
        "system.assistant",
        "system.files",
        "system.changelog",
        "system.safety_jailbreak",
        "system.safety_harmful_content",
    ],
    temperature: 0.2,
    cache: "sc",
})
```

This block sets the title of the script to "Spell checker" and specifies that it uses several system prompts, such as file operations and diff generation. The `temperature` is set to `0.1`, indicating that the script will generate output with low creativity, thus favoring precision.

### Defining the File Types to Work on

Following this, there's a `def` call:

```ts
def("FILES", files)
```

This line defines `FILES` to be the array of files we gathered.

The `$`-prefixed backtick notation is used to write the prompt template:

```ts
$`Fix the spelling and grammar of the content of <FILES>. Return the full file with corrections
If you find a spelling or grammar mistake, fix it. 
If you do not find any mistakes, respond <NO> and nothing else.

- only fix major errors
- use a technical documentation tone
- minimize changes; do NOT change the meaning of the content
- if the grammar is good enough, do NOT change it
- do NOT modify the frontmatter. THIS IS IMPORTANT.
- do NOT modify code regions. THIS IS IMPORTANT.
- do NOT fix \`code\` and \`\`\`code\`\`\` sections
- in .mdx files, do NOT fix inline typescript code
`
```

## How to Run the Script with GenAIScript CLI

Running this spell checker script is straightforward with the GenAIScript CLI. First, ensure you have the CLI installed by following the instructions in the [GenAIScript documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/genaiscript/getting-started/installation).

Once you have the CLI installed, navigate to your local copy of the script in your terminal or command line interface. Run the following command to execute the spell checker:

```shell
genaiscript convert sc "**/*.md" --rewrite
```

Remember, you do not need to specify the `.genai.mts` extension when using the `convert` command.

And there you have it—a detailed walkthrough of a GenAI spell checker script for markdown files. Happy coding and perfecting your documents!

## Content Safety

The following measures are taken to ensure the safety of the generated content.

- This script includes system prompts to prevent prompt injection and harmful content generation.
    - [system.safety_jailbreak](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/system#systemsafety_jailbreak)
    - [system.safety_harmful_content](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/system#systemsafety_harmful_content)
- The generated description is saved to a file at a specific path, which allows for a manual review before committing the changes.

Additional measures to further enhance safety would be to run [a model with a safety filter](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/content-filter?tabs=warning%2Cuser-prompt%2Cpython-new)
or validate the message with a [content safety service](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/content-safety).

Refer to the [Transparency Note](/genaiscript/reference/transparency-note/) for more information on content safety.

title: Pull Request Reviewer
description: Review the current files or changes
sidebar:
    order: 5

The following sample shows a script that analysis the changes in a pull request and posts the comments in GitHub.
We will develop the script locally and then create a GitHub Action to run it automatically.

## Add the script

- Open your GitHub repository and start a new pull request.
- Add the following script to your repository as `prr.genai.mts` in the `.genaisrc` folder.

```ts title="genaisrc/prr.genai.mts" wrap
script({
    title: "Pull Request Reviewer",
    description: "Review the current pull request",
    systemSafety: true,
    tools: ["agent_fs", "agent_git"],
    parameters: {
        base: ""
    }
})
const { dbg, vars } = env
const base = vars.base || (await git.defaultBranch())
const changes = await git.diff({
    base,
    llmify: true,
})
if (!changes) cancel("No changes found in the pull request")
dbg(`changes: %s`, changes)
const gitDiff = def("GIT_DIFF", changes, {
    language: "diff",
    maxTokens: 14000,
    detectPromptInjection: "available",
})
$`Report errors in ${gitDiff} using the annotation format.

- Use best practices of the programming language of each file.
- If available, provide a URL to the official documentation for the best practice. do NOT invent URLs.
- Analyze ALL the code. Do not be lazy. This is IMPORTANT.
- Use tools to read the entire file content to get more context
- Do not report warnings, only errors.
- Add suggestions if possible, skip if you are not sure about a fix.
`

```

- run the [GenAIScript cli](/genaiscript/cli/) to add the type definition files and fix the syntax errors in the editor (optional).

```bash
npx --yes genaiscript script fix
```

The script starts with a metadata section (`script({ ... })`) that defines the title, description, and system safety options.
The script then uses the `git` tool to get the diff of the pull request and stores it in the `GIT_DIFF` variable.

The script then uses the `$` template literal to generate a report based on the diff. The report includes best practices for the programming language of each file, and it is important to analyze all the code.
The script also includes a note to use tools to read the entire file content to get more context and to avoid reporting warnings.

The script uses the `agent_fs` and `agent_git` tools to read the files in the pull request and analyze them.

## Run the script locally

Since you are already in a pull request, you can run with the script and tune the prompting to your needs.
You can use the GenAIScript Visual Studio Code extension or use the cli.

```sh
npx --yes genaiscript run prr
```

You will see an output similar to the following. In the output, you will find links to the run reports (markdown files),
information about the model, preview of the messages and the token usage.

Open the `trace` or `output` reports in your favorite Markdown viewer to inspect the results. This part of the development
is fully local so it's your opportunity to refine the prompting.

## Automate in GitHub Actions

Using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) and [GitHub Models](https://docs.github.com/en/github-models),
you can automate the execution of the script and creation of the comments.

- Add the following workflow in your GitHub repository.

```yaml title=".github/workflows/genai-pr-review.yml" wrap
name: genai pull request review
on:
    pull_request:
        types: [ready_for_review, review_requested]
concurrency:
    group: genai-pr-review-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
    cancel-in-progress: true
permissions:
    contents: read # permission to read the repository
    pull-requests: write # permission to write a comment
    models: read # permission to use github models
jobs:
    review:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v4
            - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
              with:
                  node-version: "22"
            - name: fetch base branch
              run: git fetch origin ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.ref }}
            - name: genaiscript prr
              run: npx --yes genaiscript run prr --vars base=origin/${{ github.event.pull_request.base.ref }} --pull-request-reviews --pull-request-comment --out-trace $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
              env:
                  GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

- Commit the changes, and create a new pull request and start testing the workflow by requesting a review or toggling the `ready_for_review` event.

### Iterate!

A prompt is a living thing, models changes and they will evolve. As you start using the prompt, treat as an unfinished - every improving product.
You can always improve the prompt by adding more examples, changing the wording, or even using different models.

## Content Safety

The following measures are taken to ensure the safety of the generated content.

- This script includes system prompts to prevent prompt injection and harmful content generation.
    - [system.safety_jailbreak](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/system#systemsafety_jailbreak)
    - [system.safety_harmful_content](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/system#systemsafety_harmful_content)
- The generated description is saved to a file at a specific path, which allows for a manual review before committing the changes.

Additional measures to further enhance safety would be to run [a model with a safety filter](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/content-filter?tabs=warning%2Cuser-prompt%2Cpython-new)
or validate the message with a [content safety service](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/content-safety).

Refer to the [Transparency Note](/genaiscript/reference/transparency-note/) for more information on content safety.

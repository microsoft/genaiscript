description: We added images to the blog, this is how we did it.
cover:
  alt: "A retro-style 8-bit illustration features a computer screen with a visible
    code script. Surrounding it are symbolic representations of image
    generation: a markdown document, an image prompt morphing into abstract art,
    and a fading alt-text bubble. The design uses corporate colors, simple
    geometric shapes, and is limited to five colors, without including people or
    text."

excerpt: Automatically generating blog post cover images may sound mundane, but
  the script behind the process showcases some interesting automation
  techniques. By transforming the markdown content into an image prompt,
  generating visuals and alt text, and seamlessly updating metadata, this
  multi-step workflow demonstrates how small-scale automation can scale
  efficiently. The result? Abstract, content-driven images that hint at
  optimization potential. Thought-provoking for content creators considering
  automation workflows.

We generate cover images to the blog, this in itself is completely uninteresting... but the script that generated the images
is worth a look.

The generation of an blog post cover is done in 3 phases:

- convert the blog markdown into an image prompt
- generate an image from the image prompt
- generate an alt text description from the image prompt
- resize, copy image and patch the blog post frontmatter

<Code code={code} lang="ts" wrap title="blog-image.genai.mts" />

Once this script worked for a couple posts,
use used the `convert` command to generate the images for all the blog posts.

```sh
genaiscript convert blog-image blog/*.md*
```

## What about the images?

The images are somewhat abstract, but they are generated from the blog post content.
The image prompt could definitely be improved, but it's a good start.

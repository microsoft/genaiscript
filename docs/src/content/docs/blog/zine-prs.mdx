title: Zine Meets Pull Requests (and more)
description: A reflection about the influence of new image generator and their
    impacts on the software development assets like pull requests.

excerpt: Recent progress in AI image generation offers new possibilities for
    documenting and reviewing code changes. By using a two-step process—first
    converting a pull request diff into a visual prompt through a language model
    and then generating images from that prompt—developers can enhance their PRs
    with engaging visual summaries. This approach borrows from the "zine" format,
    blending technical detail with illustration. The workflow can streamline the
    review process by making changes easier to grasp at a glance, potentially
    increasing participation and understanding across teams. With continued
    improvements in generative models, expect even richer ways to present and
    discuss code in the near future.

The availability of new image generators like OpenAI `gpt-image-1` opens
the door to endless new ways to visualize and annotate software artifacts.

It also works for **sketchnotes!**

## Zines

["Zine"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine) is a popular graphic art form that combines text and images to tell a story.
Can we prompt the LLM to generate a zine from a pull request diff? _offline robotic voice: Yes we can_.

The script below is a 2 step LLM transformation of the pull request into a zine:

- use `gpt-4.1-mini` to transform the diff into a image generation prompt
- use `gpt-image-1` to generate the image from the prompt
-   - a bit of plumbing to upload the generated image into a branch and add it to the pull request description

<Code code={code} lang="ts" wrap title="prd-zine.genai.mts" />

## Sketchnotes (updated)

["Sketchnotes"](https://sketchyideas.co/sketchnotes/) is another style of visual note-taking that combines hand-drawn elements with text to convey information.
It is a great way to summarize a pull request and make it more engaging.

## More to come

The zine is a fun way to visualize the pull request diff. It is not perfect but it is inviting
and maybe this is all you need to get someone to review your PR!

There will be more ways to visualize software in the future, thanks to these amazing image generators.

Do you know to know an awesome trick to make GitHub Copilot Chat an expert in GenAIScript?
Here's how you can supercharge your Copilot chat with simple technique.

**Add your entire documentation to the chat session!**

Sounds crazy? Not really! The GenAIScript contains countless examples and examples of usage of APIs. It just needs to be compressed
to fit into the context window.

## How do I try this?

With the latest release of GenAIScript, you can now add a **`genaiscript`** prompt to your chat session.
This prompt, crafted by the GenAIScript team, will include the GenAIScript documentation
into the context to help the LLM provider better answers.

## How it works?

The release of the latest GitHub Copilot Chat is adding support for [reusable prompts](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_reusable-prompt-files-experimental).
GiHub Copilot Chat also added support for local workspace indexing, which helps with handling large amount of context.

GenAIScript leverages these features by adding a custom prompt that includes the GenAIScript documentation.

<Code
    code={prompt}
    wrap={true}
    lang="text"
    title=".genaiscript/prompts/genaiscript.prompt.md"
/>

## To be continued

This technique is really new and there's probably lots of improvment to be done.

In today's fast-paced development environments, maintaining a robust and efficient continuous integration (CI) workflow is essential. The automation script outlined below, built using GenAIScript, is designed to streamline the process of linting, testing, and building in a JavaScript/TypeScript project. Let's dive into the nuances of this script to understand how each segment contributes to enhancing your CI pipeline.

### Automating CI with GenAIScript

```javascript
async function automateCI() {
    // Find all JavaScript and TypeScript files in the project
    const codeFiles = await workspace.findFiles('**/*.{js,ts}');
```

The `automateCI` function begins by finding all JavaScript and TypeScript files in your project directory. The `workspace.findFiles` method uses a glob pattern (`**/*.{js,ts}`) to match files across all directories.

```javascript
    // Run a custom linter on each file
    for (const file of codeFiles) {
        const content = await workspace.readText(file);
        const issues = lintCodePlaceholder(content);
        if (issues.length > 0) {
            console.log(`Lint issues found in ${file}:`, issues);
        }
    }
```

For each file retrieved, the script reads the file content using `workspace.readText(file)` and passes this content to a placeholder linting function `lintCodePlaceholder`. This function simulates identifying linting issues, such as 'todo' comments in the code. Detected issues are then logged to the console.

```javascript
    // Run unit tests
    const testFiles = await workspace.findFiles('**/*.test.js');
    for (const testFile of testFiles) {
        const testResults = runTestsPlaceholder(testFile);
        console.log(`Test results for ${testFile}:`, testResults);
    }
```

Next, the script identifies and runs unit tests for files ending with `.test.js`. Each file is processed by a placeholder testing function `runTestsPlaceholder`, which simulates a test execution and logs the results.

```javascript
    // Build the project
    console.log('Building the project...');
    buildProjectPlaceholder();
    console.log('Build completed successfully.');
}
```

After linting and testing, the script proceeds to build the project using a simulated function `buildProjectPlaceholder`. This approach demonstrates the automation of compiling the project, crucial for ensuring that the build passes before deployment.

### Placeholder Implementations

```javascript
function lintCodePlaceholder(content) {
    return content.includes('todo') ? ['Contains TODO'] : [];
}

function runTestsPlaceholder(file) {
    return { file, result: 'Passed' };
}

function buildProjectPlaceholder() {
    console.log('Project is built.');
}
```

The placeholder functions simulate the operations typically handled by actual tools in a CI pipeline. These functions are key for developing and testing the script before integrating real tools.

### Executing the Automation Script

```javascript
automateCI();
```

Finally, the script is set in motion by calling `automateCI()`. This triggers the automated processes in sequence, demonstrating a modular and scalable approach to automating CI tasks.

### Conclusion

This tutorial provided a detailed walkthrough of automating a CI workflow using GenAIScript, focusing on JavaScript and TypeScript projects. By incorporating such scripts into your development process, you can significantly enhance the efficiency and reliability of your CI pipelines, allowing your team to deliver higher quality software at a faster pace. 🚀

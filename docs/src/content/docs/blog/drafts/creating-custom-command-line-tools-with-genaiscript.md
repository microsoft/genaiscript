Creating custom command line tools is an exciting way to automate tasks and streamline workflows. With GenAIScript, you can easily design and implement these tools. In this blog post, we will explore how to write a script that generates a simple command line tool using GenAIScript. Let's dive into the code to understand each component and how they work together.

### Step 1: Import Required Modules

```javascript
const { exec } = require('child_process');
```
In the first line of our script, we import the `exec` function from the `child_process` module. While this particular example doesn't use `exec`, it's commonly used in scripts for running other command line commands within your Node.js applications.

### Step 2: Define the Command Creator Function

```javascript
function createCommand(toolName, command, description) {
  return `#!/usr/bin/env node
console.log('Tool: ${toolName}, Command: ${command}, Description: ${description}');`;
}
```
This function, `createCommand`, takes three parameters: `toolName`, `command`, and `description`. It returns a string that constitutes a script. The script starts with a shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env node`) indicating that it should run with Node.js. This function essentially templates out a simple command line tool that logs its name, command, and description to the console.

### Step 3: Define the File Writing Function

```javascript
function writeToFile(fileName, content) {
  require('fs').writeFileSync(fileName, content, 'utf8');
}
```
The `writeToFile` function takes two arguments: `fileName` and `content`. It writes the content to the specified file using Node.js's `fs` module, which handles file system operations. Here, `writeFileSync` is used to write data synchronously to the file system.

### Step 4: Generate the Tool

```javascript
function generateTool(toolName, command, description, outputFile) {
  const scriptContent = createCommand(toolName, command, description);
  writeToFile(outputFile, scriptContent);
}
```
The `generateTool` function combines the above functionalities to generate a complete tool. It first creates the script content using `createCommand` and then writes this content to a file specified by `outputFile`.

### Step 5: Execute the Tool Generation

```javascript
generateTool('GenAIScriptTool', 'run', 'Custom command line tool created using GenAIScript.', 'customTool.js');
```
Finally, we call `generateTool` with specific arguments to create a new command line tool named `GenAIScriptTool`. This script logs a simple message and is written to `customTool.js`.

### Conclusion

This example demonstrates the fundamental steps in creating a command line tool using GenAIScript. By modifying the `createCommand` function, you can expand the capabilities of your custom tools to perform various automated tasks. These tools can greatly enhance your productivity and the efficiency of your development workflows. ðŸš€

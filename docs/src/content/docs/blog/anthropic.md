  alt: A stylized 8-bit image depicts a geometric computer screen with pixelated
    icons representing GitHub and Microsoft logos. These icons are connected
    through a network diagram, illustrating digital collaboration. The image
    uses a limited palette of five corporate colors to emphasize the theme of
    teamwork in code contribution. The background remains simple to focus
    attention on the depicted network connections.

  contributions from [@waltoss](https://github.com/waltoss). While a few tasks
  remain, the groundwork is solid. For guidance on configuring the model, check

Big thanks to [@waltoss](https://github.com/waltoss) who contributed the [Anthropic model](https://github.com/microsoft/genaiscript/pull/788) support. There are still some [TODOs](https://github.com/microsoft/genaiscript/discussions/790) but the basics are in place.

cover:
  alt: Three side-by-side square frames, each showing a uniquely posed 8-bit style
    pixel cat. Each frame visually represents image generation from different AI
    models, using five flat corporate colors and minimalist geometric
    backgrounds. The cats are simple, highly pixelated, and visually distinct
    from one another, with no text or people present, creating a clean,
    corporate, and comparative visual suitable for a blog.

excerpt: Our team just launched support for the new OpenAI gpt-image-1 image
  generation model, now available through both OpenAI’s API and Azure AI
  Foundry. We compared gpt-image-1 to DALL·E 2 and DALL·E 3 by generating 8-bit
  pixel cat images using the same prompt. Each model produces distinct visual
  results, and gpt-image-1 brings its own style and interpretation. This update
  helps you evaluate how current generative models handle familiar creative
  tasks while leveraging advances in image synthesis. Try running the same
  workflows you use for existing models to see how output and prompt handling
  differ with gpt-image-1.

We've added support for the new OpenAI `gpt-image-1` image generation model.
You can try out through OpenAI's API or Azure AI Foundry.

```js 'model: "openai:gpt-image-1"'
... = await generateImage("...", {
    model: "openai:gpt-image-1",
})
```

To compare the performance of this model, here is a little script that
generate an pixelated cat image on DallE-2/3 and `gpt-image-1`.

```js title="images.genai.mjs" wrap
const { output } = env
for (const model of [
    "openai:dall-e-2",
    "openai:dall-e-3",
    "openai:gpt-image-1",
]) {
    output.heading(3, `Model: ${model}`)
    const { image, revisedPrompt } = await generateImage(
        `a cute cat. only one. iconic, high details. 8-bit resolution.`,
        {
            maxWidth: 400,
            mime: "image/png",
            model,
            size: "square",
        }
    )
    await env.output.image(image.filename)
    output.fence(revisedPrompt)
}
```

Visualize an adorable single feline, lavishly detailed, represented in charming 8-bit resolution. This cat is incredibly distinctive and recognizable, with unique features that make it stand out from the norm. Consider adding intricate patterns on its fur or any other unusual characteristics to boost the iconic nature of this cute cat.

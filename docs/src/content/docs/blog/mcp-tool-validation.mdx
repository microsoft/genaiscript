excerpt: GenAIScript has introduced updates to enhance the security of Model
    Context Protocol (MCP) tools, addressing vulnerabilities like rug pull
    attacks, tool poisoning, and prompt injection. With options for tools
    signature hashing and prompt injection detection via content scanners, these
    features provide reinforced safeguards to maintain integrity across tool
    definitions and outputs. Ensure your configurations are up to date for
    comprehensive protection.

GenAIScript added a few feature to secure Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools and mitigate specific attacks such as rug pull, tool poisoning, or prompt injection.

Starting with `v1.127`, you can configure the following options as [documented here](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/mcp-tools#security):

- tools signature hash to prevent rug pull attacks, where the list of tools is modified without your knowledge.

```js 'toolsSha: "..."'
script({
    mcpServers: {
        playwright: {
            ...,
            toolsSha: "..."
        }
    }
})
```

- prompt injection detect using [content safety scanner](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/content-safety). This will scan both the tools definition file, to prevent **tool poisoning** and every tool output,
  to prevent **prompt injection**.

```js 'detectPromptInjection: "always"'
script({
    mcpServers: {
        playwright: {
            ...,
            detectPromptInjection: "always"
        }
    }
})
```

- in fact, every tool can be instrumented with content safety scanning.

```js 'detectPromptInjection: "always"'
defTool("fetch", "Fetch a URL", { url: { type: "string" }, },
    async args => ..., {
    detectPromptInjection: "always"
})
```

### Are we done?

There are still many other security aspects to consider when using MCP tools, these features are just a few of them.

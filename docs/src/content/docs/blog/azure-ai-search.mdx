  alt: The image shows a cartoon-like computer interface featuring a "retrieval
    index" with a magnifying glass icon and several files, which are illustrated
    with animal icons of cats and dogs. This represents the process of indexing
    in a vector database. There is a visual flow from the files to the database,
    using icons to depict cats and dogs for the purpose of similarity search.
    The style is characterized by bold geometric shapes, using a limited
    corporate color palette of five colors, and maintaining a simple 8-bit
    aesthetic.

excerpt: Discover how GenAIScript simplifies interaction with Azure AI Search
  for building vector-based search systems. With built-in support for chunking,
  vectorization, and indexing, you can efficiently implement Retrieval Augmented
  Generation (RAG) workflows, leveraging embeddings for similarity searches
  across your data. Learn how to streamline file indexing and query execution
  using straightforward functions and enhance your AI toolset.

The `retrieval` APIs has been extended to support [Azure AI Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-what-is-azure-search).
This allows you to index files using embeddings into a vector database that can be used for similarity search.
This is commonly referred to as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

```js wrap '{ type: "azure_ai_search" }'
// index creation
const index = retrieval.index("animals", { type: "azure_ai_search" })
// indexing
await index.insertOrUpdate(env.files)
// search
const res = await index.search("cat dog")
def("RAG", res)
```

GenAIScript provides a simple and efficient way to interact with Azure AI Search. It will handle
chunking, vecorization, and indexing of the files. The `retrieval.index` function creates an index
with the specified name and type. The `insertOrUpdate` function indexes the files into the database.
Finally, the `search` function retrieves the files that match the query.

One can also use the command line interface to index files ahead of time.

    JavaScript, transformers, and AI. These icons are integrated into an
    arrangement of abstract geometric shapes that represent a browser and server
    environment. The image is simplified using a 5-color palette, maintaining a

[Hugging Face Transformers.js](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/index)
is a JavaScript library that provides a simple way to run LLMs in the browser or node.js (or Bun, Deno, ...).

With the latest GenAIScript, you can use [Text Generation Models](https://huggingface.co/tasks/text-generation#completion-generation-models) directly in the script configuration
using the [transformers](/genaiscript/getting-started/configuration#transformers) model provider.

```js 'model: "transformers:HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct:q4f16"'
script({
    model: "transformers:HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct:q4f16",
})
```

GenAIScript will download and cache the model for you, and you can start using it right away
**fully locally**.

There are [plenty of models](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-generation&library=transformers.js) to choose from and you can also follow the Hugging Face documentation to fine tune your own.

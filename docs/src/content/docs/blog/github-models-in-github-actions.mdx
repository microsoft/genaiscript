excerpt: "Streamlining your CI/CD processes just got easier: GitHub Actions now
  lets you use GITHUB_TOKEN for authentication with GitHub Models. By connecting
  your workflows directly to these AI capabilities, you can sidestep the hassle
  of managing separate personal access tokens and keep your automations secure
  and maintainable. This update supports a seamless integration path for teams
  looking to enhance workflow intelligence within the GitHub ecosystem."

You can now use `GITHUB_TOKEN` from GitHub Actions to authenticate requests to [GitHub Models](https://github.com/marketplace/models)!!!

```yaml title="genai.yml" wrap "models: read" "GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
permissions:
  models: read
jobs:
    genai:
        steps:
          run: npx -y genaiscript run ...
            env:
                GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

This simplifies your workflows by integrating AI capabilities directly into your actions, 
eliminating the need to generate and manage Personal Access Tokens (PATs)!

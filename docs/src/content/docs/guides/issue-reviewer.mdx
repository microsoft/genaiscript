This guide shows how to automate reviewing issues 
with a GenAIScript that provides feedback and code analysis in GitHub Actions.

## Resolving the issue

The script starts by getting the current issue information from the GitHub API.

```js title="issue-reviewer.genai.mjs"
const { title, body } = await github.getIssue()
```

The `github.getIssue` assumes that GenAIScript is running in a GitHub Action, 
it will have access to the github token (`GITHUB_TOKEN`) and the `GITHUB_ISSUE` issue id.

The `GITHUB_ISSUE` needs to be configured in the GitHub Action from the `github.event.issue` object.

```yaml title="github-action.yml" "GITHUB_ISSUE: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}" wrap
jobs:
  review:
    - run: ...
      env:
        GITHUB_ISSUE: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
```


## The task

The prompt sets the task and how to perform the review in a system message.

```js title="issue-reviewer.genai.mts" wrap
$`## Tasks

You are an expert developer and have been asked to review an issue. 

Review the TITLE and BODY and report your feedback that will be added as a comment to the issue.
`.role("system")
```

## The context

Then it adds the issue title and body to the prompt.

```js title="issue-reviewer.genai.mts" wrap
def("TITLE", title)
def("BODY", body)
```

## Automation in Github Actions

Add this step to your Github Actions workflow to automate the issue review process.
The `-prc` flag stands for [--pull-request-comment](/genaiscript/reference/cli/run#pull-requests)
and takes care of upserting a comment in the pull request/issue conversation.

```yaml wrap
permissions:
    content: read # permission to read the repository
    issues: write # permission to write a comment
...
    - run: npx --yes genaiscript run issue-reviewer -prc --out-trace $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
      env:
        GITHUB_ISSUE: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        ... # LLM secrets
```

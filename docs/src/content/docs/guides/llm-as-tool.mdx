It is possible [tools](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/tools)
and [inline prompts](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/inline-prompts)
to create a tool that uses an LLM model to execute a prompt.

```js "defTool" "runPrompt"
defTool(
    "llm-small",
    "Invokes smaller LLM",
    {
        prompt: {
            type: "string",
            description: "the prompt to be executed by the LLM",
        },
    },
    async ({ prompt }) =>
        await runPrompt(prompt, {
            model: "small",
            label: "llm-small",
        })
)
```

The `"small"` model is an alias that can be configured in the `script` metadata, cli arguments or environment variables.

```js "small"
script({
    smallModel: "openai:gpt-4o-mini",
})
```

The inlined prompts can declare their own tools or use system prompts declaring them.

```js 'tools: "fs"'
defTool(
    "agent_file_system",
    `An agent that uses gpt-4o to execute an LLM requests with tools that can search and read the file system.
    `,
    {
        prompt: {
            type: "string",
            description: "the prompt to be executed by the LLM",
        },
    },
    async ({ prompt }) =>
        await env.generator.runPrompt(
            (_) => {

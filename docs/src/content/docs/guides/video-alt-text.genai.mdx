GenAIScript supports [speech transcription](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/transcription)
and [video frame extraction](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/videos) which can be combined to analyze videos.

## Video Alt Text

The HTML video attribute does not have an `alt` attribute.. but you can still attach a accessible description using the `aria-label` attribute.
We will build a script that generates the description using the transcript and video frames.

## Transcript

We use the `transcribe` function to generate the transcript. It will use the `transcription` model alias to compute a transcription.
For OpenAI, it defaults to `openai:whisper-1`.

Transcriptions are useful to reduce hallucations of LLMs when analyzing images and also provides
good timestemp candidates to screenshot the video stream.

```js
const file = env.files[0]
const transcript = await transcribe(file) // OpenAI whisper
```

## Video Frames

The next step is to use the transcript to screenshot the video stream. GenAIScript uses [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to render the frames
so make sure you have it installed and configured.

```js
const frames = await ffmpeg.extractFrames(file, {
    transcript,
})
```

## Context

Both the transcript and the frames are added to the prompt context. Since some videos may be silent, we ignore empty transcripts.
We also use low detail for the frames to improve performance.

```js
def("TRANSCRIPT", transcript?.srt, { ignoreEmpty: true }) // ignore silent videos
defImages(frames, { detail: "low" }) // low detail for better performance
```

## Prompting it together

Finally, we give the task to the LLM to generate the alt text.

```js
$`You are an expert in assistive technology.
You will analyze the video and generate a description alt text for the video.
`
```

Using this script, you can automatically generate high quality alt text for videos.

```sh
npx --yes genaiscript run video-alt-text path_to_video.mp4
```

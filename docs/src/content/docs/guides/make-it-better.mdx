Surprising results happen when you repeatidely ask the LLM to "make it better" (see [blog post](https://minimaxir.com/2025/01/write-better-code/)).

In this sample, we use the `makeItBetter` function from the `genaiscript/runtime`
to acheive exaclty that: asking the LLM to make it better for a few rounds.

## Code Explanation

Let's walk through the script line by line:

```js
import { makeItBetter } from "genaiscript/runtime"
```

This line imports the `makeItBetter` function from the GenAIScript runtime. This function is used to improve code by repeating a set of instructions multiple times.

```js
def("CODE", env.files)
```

This line defines a constant named "CODE" that represents the files in the environment. It essentially sets up the context for the code that needs improvement.

```js
$`Analyze and improve the code.`
```

This line is a prompt for the AI model. It instructs the system to analyze and enhance the code. The `$` is used to denote that this is a special instruction, not a regular code command.

```js
makeItBetter({ repeat: 2 })
```

This line calls the `makeItBetter` function with an option to repeat the improvement process twice. It registers a [chat participant](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/chat-participants)
that injects messages in the chat conversation loop.

The `makeItBetter` rouhgly looks like this. It registers a callback function that gets called
on every chat turn.

```js
export function makeItBetter(options?: { repeat: ... }) {
    let round = 0
    defChatParticipant((cctx) => {
        if (round++ < repeat) {
            cctx.console.log(`make it better (round ${round})`)
            cctx.$`make it better`
        }
    })
}
```

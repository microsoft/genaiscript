Using [functions (tools)](/genaiscript/reference/functions),
you can define a built-in agent that can take decisions
and reasoning based on the tools provided to it.

Let's illustrate this concept using the [llamaindex sum div sample](https://ts.llamaindex.ai/examples/agent):
an agent that can sum or divide two numbers and needs to answer basic arithmetic questions.

## Using functions

By declaring functions (and providing a descriptive description), you provide the opportunity
for the LLM to requests a function call during the output generation. In the snippet below,
we declare a function that can sum two numbers. It will be called by the LLM when a sum operation
is required.

```js "defFunction"
defFunction(
    "sum",
    "Use this function to sum two numbers",
    {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
            a: {
                type: "number",
                description: "The first number",
            },
            b: {
                type: "number",
                description: "The second number",
            },
        },
        required: ["a", "b"],
    },
    ({ a, b }) => `${a + b}`
)
```

## Parameters

The arithmetic question can be declared as a [script
parameter](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/variables) to be used in the agent script.

```js "parameters"
script({
    ...,
    parameters: {
        "question": {
            type: "string",
            default: "How much is 5 + 5? then divide by 2?"
        }
    }
})
```

The parameter value are populated in the `env.vars` object.

```js "env.vars.question"
...
$`Answer the following arithmetic question:

    ${env.vars.question}
`
```

Putting it all together, we define another function to divide two numbers
and inline an arithmetic question.

## Using `system.math`

The system prompt [system.math](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/system#systemmath)
wraps the `parsers.math` expression parser and evaluator and exposes it as a function.

This simplifies the agent script as we do not have to define functions anymore.

<Code
    title="math-agent.genai.js"
    code={mathAgentSystemSrc}
    wrap={true}
    lang="js"
/>

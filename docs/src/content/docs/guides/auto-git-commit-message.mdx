In the world of software development, making consistent and informative commit messages is crucial but often overlooked.
This task can become tedious, especially when you are in the flow of coding.
To help with this, we've crafted a [script tailored to automate generating Git commit messages](<](https://github.com/microsoft/genaiscript/blob/main/genaisrc/gcm.genai.mts)>),
ensuring they are meaningful and save you time.

The script acts as a regular node.js automation script and uses [runPrompt](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/inner-prompts)
to issue calls to the LLM and ask the user to confirm the generated text.

## 🔍 **Explaining the Script**

The script begins by importing necessary functions from [@inquirer/prompts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@inquirer/prompts):

```ts
import { select, input, confirm } from "@inquirer/prompts"
```

These functions will be used to interact with the user, asking them to confirm actions or input data.

Next, we check if there are any staged changes in the Git repository:

```ts
let { stdout } = await host.exec("git", ["diff", "--cached"])
```

If no changes are staged, we ask the user if they want to stage all changes. If the user confirms, we stage all changes. Otherwise, we bail out.

```ts
    const stage = await confirm({
        message: "No staged changes. Stage all changes?",
        default: true,
    })
    if (stage) {
        await host.exec("git", ["add", "."])
        stdout = (await host.exec("git", ["diff", "--cached"])).stdout
    }
    if (!stdout) cancel("no staged changes")
```

We generate an initial commit message using the staged changes:

```ts
message = (
    await runPrompt(
        (_) => {
            _.def("GIT_DIFF", stdout, { maxTokens: 20000 })
            _.$`GIT_DIFF is a diff of all staged changes, coming from the command:
\`\`\`
git diff --cached
\`\`\`
Please generate a concise, one-line commit message for these changes.
- do NOT add quotes`
        },
        { cache: false, temperature: 0.8 }
    )
).text
```

The prompt configuration above indicates that the message should be concise,
related to the "git diff --cached" output, and should not include quotes.

User chooses how to proceed with the generated message:

```ts
    choice = await select({
        message,
        choices: [
            { name: "commit", value: "commit", description: "accept message and commit" },
            ...
        ],
    })
```

Options are given to edit or regenerate the message. If the user chooses to edit the message, we ask them to input a new message:

```ts
if (choice === "edit") {
    message = await input({
        message: "Edit commit message",
        required: true,
    })
    choice = "commit"
}
```

If the user chooses to commit the message, we commit the changes:

```ts
if (choice === "commit" && message) {
    console.log((await host.exec("git", ["commit", "-m", message])).stdout)
}
```

## 🚀 **Running the Script**

You can run this script using the [CLI](/genaiscript/reference/cli).

```bash
genaiscript run gcm
```

Since it uses the [@inquirer/prompts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@inquirer/prompts) package, you will need to install this package first:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @inquirer/prompts
```

If you are using [npx](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npx),

```bash
npx -p @inquirer/prompts -p genaiscript  -- genaiscript run gcm
```

This command will run the script, and guide you through the process of generating and committing a Git message using AI, making your commits more informative and consistent.

You can wrap this command in a `gcm.sh` file or in your package `script` section in `package.json`:

```json '"gcm": "genaiscript run gcm"'
{
    "devDependencies": {
        "@inquirer/prompts": "...",
        "genaiscript": "..."
    },
    "scripts": {
        "gcm": "genaiscript run gcm"
    }
}
```

Then you can run the script using:

```bash
npm run gcm
```

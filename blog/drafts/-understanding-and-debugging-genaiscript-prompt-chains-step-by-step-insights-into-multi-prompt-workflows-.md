# "Understanding and Debugging GenAIScript Prompt Chains: Step-by-Step Insights into Multi-Prompt Workflows"

GenAIScript has emerged as a powerful tool for orchestrating AI prompt chains‚Äîsequences of prompts where each step depends on the results of the previous. Writing robust, understandable GenAIScript prompt chains is key for project managers, developers, and AI enthusiasts who want to automate multi-step reasoning or plan complex workflows. In this post, we‚Äôll break down how to design a step-by-step, debuggable GenAIScript prompt chain using a real-world example.

Let‚Äôs walk through the featured script line-by-line and understand **how each part contributes to clarity, maintainability, and transparency**. üöÄ

## Script Overview

The script creates an interactive prompt chain that:

1. Gathers requirements from the user.
2. Designs a high-level solution.
3. Identifies implementation risks.
4. Suggests mitigations.
5. Summarizes everything as a markdown report.

Each stage includes debugging logs to help trace the flow and debug issues efficiently.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

```javascript
script({
    name: "Prompt Chain Debugger",
    description: "Step-by-step demonstration and debugging of a multi-prompt workflow in GenAIScript"
})
```

- **Purpose**: Defines the metadata for your script. The `name` allows others to identify your workflow, and the `description` gives a concise summary.
- [Docs: Script Object](https://microsoft.github.io/genaiscript/docs/topics/concepts/#script-object)

---

```javascript
// Step 1: Gather requirements from the user
const requirements = await $`You are a project manager. Ask the user to describe the feature or problem they want to address in their project. Respond with a clear, concise requirements summary.`
```

- üìã **Purpose**: The first prompt involves the user directly. The `$` function executes a prompt as if you were chatting with an LLM.
- `await` ensures you capture the LLM‚Äôs response before moving on.
- [Docs: Using LLM Prompts](https://microsoft.github.io/genaiscript/docs/topics/prompting/)

---

```javascript
// Debug: Log the requirements for inspection
log("Step 1 - Requirements:", requirements)
```

- üêû **Purpose**: The `log` function is used here for debugging. By logging each step, you gain visibility into intermediate results‚Äîessential for debugging long chains.
- [Docs: Logging](https://microsoft.github.io/genaiscript/docs/topics/debugging/)

---

```javascript
// Step 2: Generate a design proposal based on requirements
const designProposal = await $`You are a senior developer. Based on the following requirements, propose a high-level design (1-2 paragraphs). Requirements: ${requirements}`
```

- üèó **Purpose**: Uses the output from Step 1 as input to build on context. Chaining variables like `${requirements}` maintains session state between prompts.
- **Tip**: Always use template literals to inject context from previous steps.

---

```javascript
// Debug: Log the design proposal
log("Step 2 - Design Proposal:", designProposal)
```

- üîé **Purpose**: Again, we log for clarity and easier debugging.

---

```javascript
// Step 3: Identify possible implementation challenges
const challenges = await $`You are a software architect. Review the design proposal below. List 2-3 potential implementation challenges or risks. Proposal: ${designProposal}`
```

- üõë **Purpose**: This prompt examines the proposal and introduces critical thinking. Chained context aids the AI in staying relevant.

---

```javascript
// Debug: Log the challenges
log("Step 3 - Challenges:", challenges)
```

- üîç **Purpose**: Regular logging after each transformative step helps pinpoint issues faster if later steps go awry.

---

```javascript
// Step 4: Suggest mitigations for each challenge
const mitigations = await $`You are an engineering lead. For each challenge listed below, suggest a mitigation strategy or workaround. Challenges: ${challenges}`
```

- üõ† **Purpose**: This step closes the loop, generating actionable advice based on detected challenges.

---

```javascript
// Debug: Log the mitigations
log("Step 4 - Mitigations:", mitigations)
```

- üìù **Purpose**: Final log before summary. At this point, you can examine all major workflow outputs.

---

```javascript
// Step 5: Summarize the workflow for the user
$`Summarize the entire workflow, including requirements, design, challenges, and mitigations, as a markdown report for the user. Use clear headings for each section. 
Requirements: ${requirements} 
Design Proposal: ${designProposal} 
Challenges: ${challenges} 
Mitigations: ${mitigations}`
```

- üìÑ **Purpose**: The final prompt to the LLM assembles a readable, clear markdown report for end users, summarizing the entire chain.
- **TIP**: Use markdown format to ensure readable and publishable outputs.

---

## Why This Approach Works

- **Debuggability**: Logging after every crucial step makes the script easy to debug and maintain.
- **Transparency**: Users and developers can inspect intermediate outputs and grasp how the final report is constructed.
- **Chaining Context**: By feeding prompt outputs into subsequent steps, you maintain coherence and continuity across your workflow.

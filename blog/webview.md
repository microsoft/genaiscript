In the past, our Visual Studio Code visualization has relied on the built-in Markdown preview feature. It's been working great but sometimes it's not enough. We wanted to provide a more interactive experience for our users. So we decided to build a custom webview for GenAIScript.

Rebuilding the view also gives us more control on supporting the rendering of various markdown subformats like mermaid diagrams, annotations, math, ...

As we test and migrate to the new view, the old `Output`/`Trace` menu items are still available from the status bar menu.

## Accessing the view outside of Visual Studio Code

As a result of this change, you can now access the GenAIScript view outside of Visual Studio Code. This means you can now **run** your scripts in a browser or any other webview-capable application.

Launch the [serve](/genaiscript/reference/cli/serve) command from the [cli](/genaiscript/reference/cli) to start the server and follow the instructions to open the view in your browser.

```sh
genaiscript serve
```

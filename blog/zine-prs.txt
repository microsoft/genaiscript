When developers document code changes, it can be tough to visualize what’s really going on. Imagine transforming those dense pull requests into a zine—a clever, illustrated booklet that mixes technical detail with expressive artwork. This blog explores using advanced AI, like language and image generation models, in a two-step process: one model rewrites a code difference into a friendly visual prompt, then another brings it to life with a creative image. The result is an engaging summary that makes code reviews more inviting and easier for the whole team to grasp at a glance.

While the zine approach isn’t flawless, it opens the door for more imaginative ways to review and discuss software changes. As generative AI keeps advancing, expect even more playful and insightful tools that can help demystify code and spark better collaboration across development teams.

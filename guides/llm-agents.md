An **[agent](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/agents)** is a special kind of [tool](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/tools) that
uses an [inline prompt](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/inline-prompts) and [tools](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/tools) to solve a task.

## Usage

We want to build a script that can investigate the most recent run failures in a GitHub repository using GitHub Actions.
To do so, we probably will need to the following agents:

- query the GitHub API, `agent_github`
- compute some git diff to determine which changes broken the build, `agent_git`
- read or search files `agent_fs`

```js wrap title="github-investigator.genai.mts"
script({
    tools: ["agent_fs", "agent_git", "agent_github", ...],
    ...
})
```

Each of these agent is capable of calling an LLM with a specific set of tools to accomplish a task.

The full script source code is available below:

<Code
    code={source}
    wrap={true}
    lang="js"
    title="github-investigator.genai.mts"
/>

## Multiple instances of the same agent

Some agents, like `agent_git`, can be instantiated with different parameters, like working on different repositories.

<Code code={sourceMulti} wrap={true} lang="js" title="multi-agents.genai.mts" />

In such case, make sure to provide a `variant` argument that will be used to generate a unique agent name.

## To split or not to split

You could try to load all the tools in the same LLM call and run the task as a single LLM conversation.
Results may vary.

```js wrap title="github-investigator.genai.mts"
script({
    tools: ["fs", "git", "github", ...],
    ...
})
```

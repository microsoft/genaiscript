GenAIScript is a scripting language that makes LLMs a first-class part of the scripting process, easily allowing users to author, debug, and deploy LLM-based scripts that can perform tasks beyond the reach of conventional code. This reference guide provides comprehensive documentation for GenAIScripts, including script syntax, LLM configurations, the VSCode extension, and the CLI.

- [Scripts](/genaiscript/reference/scripts) provide a domain-specific JavaScript framework to build LLM requests.
- [CLI](/genaiscript/reference/cli) documents the command-line interface to automate GenAIScripts executions.
- [Visual Studio Code Extension](/genaiscript/reference/vscode) provides a rich set of features to author, debug, and deploy GenAIScripts.

## Developer setup

You can open this repo in GitHub CodeSpace/Docker to get the build environment needed.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=679784368)

- Go to https://github.com/microsoft/genaiscript
- Click on **Code**
- Select Create new Codespace
- Select the **dev** branch
### Manual setup

- Install [Node.JS LTS](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- Run yarn

```sh
yarn install --frozen-lockfile --prefer-offline
```

## Build

You can do a full compile using esbuild.

```sh
yarn compile
```

or a typecheck using `tsc`.

```sh
yarn typecheck
```

or start a debug session in VSCode.

- Start the **Run - sample** Debugger to launch the sample project in debugging mode

## Running local scripts

To run a script using the locally built cli,

```sh
yarn genai <scriptid> ...
```

To run a sample script under the `packages/sample` folder:

```sh
yarn run:script <scriptid> ...
```

In this case, it will use the `packages/sample/.env` file for the environment variables and workspace will be rooted at `packages/sample`.

## Debugging local scripts

Open a `JavaScript Debug Terminal` and launch the script using

```sh
yarn genai:debug <scriptid> ...
```

or for samples

```sh
yarn run:script:debug <scriptid> ...
```

## Logging

GenAIScript uses the [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) library for logging. You can enable logging by setting the `DEBUG` environment variable to `genai:*`.

```sh
DEBUG=genai:* yarn genai <scriptid> ...
```

## Web viewer

The web application (React 19) is meant to run both as a Visual Studio Code panel and a standalone viewer (**playground**). For testing purposes, standalone is the easiest.

- React 19, currently very little dependeices
- react-markdown + a few plugins to run the markdown
- [vscode-elements](https://vscode-elements.github.io/) is the design system we use as it mimics the vscode look and feel.

### Running playground

To run the playground, use the following command:

```sh
yarn serve
```

It will start a local server and rebuild the react client on file changes. **It will not rebuild/restart the server on changes.**
There is **no** hot reload, you need to refresh the browser. If some state should be serialized, we should start adding it to the hash.

## Dependencies

- run `yarn install:force` to refresh the lock file
- run `yarn gen:licenses` to refresh the 3rd party licenses

## Docs

Run `docs` to launch the documentation site.

```sh
yarn docs
```

GitHub Pages are automatically updated on new release; or thourh manual trigger at
https://github.com/microsoft/genaiscript/actions/workflows/docs.yml .

## Slides

All files `slides/*slides.md` will be compiled and deployed on build.

- run `slides` to launch the slide show (add the file name or it will default to `slides.md`)

```sh
yarn slides [slides file name]
```

- visit http://localhost:3030

Learn more about Slidev on [documentations](https://sli.dev/). For diagrams, leverage [mermaid](https://sli.dev/guide/syntax#diagrams) or use draw.io, tldraw.

## GenAIScripts

- Commit with aut-generated message

```sh
yarn gcm
```

## Packaging

To compile and package the Visual Studio Code extension, run the `package` script.

```sh
yarn package
```

You will find the built package files, `genaiscript.vsix`,
in the `packages/vscode` folder.

## Release

Run the `release` script.

```sh
yarn release
```

## Documentation basics

Start local server

```sh
yarn docs
```

## Local AI

If you are lacking a OpenAI API token, you can use [LocalAI](https://localai.io/basics/getting_started/) to simulate OpenAI access.

- Create a new Codespace and make sure to create a larger image,
- launch `localai` to download and start the localai docker image.

```
yarn run localai
```

- Launch the localai web ui at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- create `.env` file with

```dot
# OPENAI_API_KEY=... not needed
OPENAI_API_BASE=http://localhost:8080/v1
```

- start the debugger and voila!

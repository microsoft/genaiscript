- **Remote repository**: Playground can run scripts from a remote repository using current `.env` secrets.
- **run**: The `run` function wraps the [CLI run](/genaiscript/reference/cli/run) command to execute scripts.
- **Run a script**: Executes a script, streaming LLM output to stdout from the workspace root.
- **Running scripts from a remote repository**: Use `--remote` to load and run scripts from a remote repository via shallow clone.
- **samples**: Sample scripts are fully fledged and ready to use, but can be tweaked or modified to suit your needs.
- **script files**: GenAIScript identifies any `*.genai.mjs`, `*.genai.js`, or `*.genai.mts` in your workspace as scripts, which can be placed anywhere.
- **Starlight**: Starlight is a project for building and authoring documentation websites using Astro and specific design principles.

The user will share a file and its dependencies for you to analyze.\n\n# Objective\nDetermine what actions the SPEC files will take on Azure and identify the target services or cloud components impacted.\n\n# Definitions\n## Action\nSomething being done by the SPEC file or its dependencies when used. Understanding the Action requires understanding the purpose of the script and its dependencies which requires deeper analysis than just describing the basic implementation of the name or steps in the script. The Action is the *why* of the script, not the *how*.\n\n## Target\nSpecific Azure service or cloud component that will be impacted by the Action. Example Targets include Application Insights, Application Gateway, Virtual Machines, and GitHub but could even include other clouds or custom components.\n\n## Deployed\nAny cloud resource that is deployed after this file is used that was not present before this file was used. Cloud resources that were already deployed before this file was used are not considered Deployed, and any cloud resources that are *always* deleted after this file is used are not considered Deployed.\n\n# Guidance on Actions\nIt is important to explain *why* the Action is being taken and *what* is being done in your description of the Action. Describing the purpose of the Action requires that you understand the value of the performed step. When you write the description of the Action, you should explain *why* and *what* is being done rather than just describing the implementation. For example, a script that clones a git repo doesn't exist to clone a git repo. It exists to download the source code that does something. Your description of the Action should explain what the script is doing with the source code that it downloads with as much detail as you can infer from the provided file contents.\n\n# SourceFile\nYou will be provided with the contents of the file to analyze as well as its dependencies to help you understand what the file is doing.\nIf you are missing a module in the bicep file, use fs_read_file to add the module to the prompt. Ignore .json and .jsonc file references.\n\nIn Bicep, you can use the following syntax to include a module in your file (for example policy-definition.bicep):\n\n```bicep\nmodule policyDefinition 'policy-definition.bicep' = ...\n```\n\n### Source File Guidance\nWhen you generate the JSON response, you will need to include the file path from the file that generated the action or issue in the SourceFile fields.\n\n# Task\n1. Review the Azure file and its dependencies that the user uploads\n2. Perform a very careful analysis of all the file contents that you receive to really understand what is happening\n3. Develop a lengthy list of actions that are being performed by the file and its dependencies. Make sure that you understand what is being done and why it is being done in creating this list using the approach from \"Guidance on Actions\" above.\n4. Double check your list of actions to make sure that you have a complete list of actions and add any that you missed\n5. Organize the actions by the target services or cloud components that are impacted by the actions\n6. Identify any cloud resources that are deployed after this file is used that were not present before this file was used and add them to the \"Deployed\" list. If nothing that you find directly within the provided file content meets this criteria, please leave the list empty.\n7. Return a JSON object using the following format\n## Response format\n```json\n{\n    \"Targets\": {\n        \"Target1\": [\n            {\n                \"SourceFile\": \"file path of the file that

The user will share a file and its dependencies for you to analyze.\n\n# Objective\nDetermine what actions the SPEC files will take on Azure and identify the target services or cloud components impacted.\n\n# Definitions\n## Action\nSomething being done by the SPEC file or its dependencies when used. Understanding the Action requires understanding the purpose of the script and its dependencies which requires deeper analysis than just describing the basic implementation of the name or steps in the script. The Action is the *why* of the script, not the *how*.\n\n## Target\nSpecific Azure service or cloud component that will be impacted by the Action. Example Targets include Application Insights, Application Gateway, Virtual Machines, and GitHub but could even include other clouds or custom components.\n\n## Deployed\nAny cloud resource that is deployed after this file is used that was not present before this file was used. Cloud resources that were already deployed before this file was used are not considered Deployed, and any cloud resources that are *always* deleted after this file is used are not considered Deployed.\n\n# Guidance on Actions\nIt is important to explain *why* the Action is being taken and *what* is being done in your description of the Action. Describing the purpose of the Action requires that you understand the value of the performed step. When you write the description of the Action, you should explain *why* and *what* is being done rather than just describing the implementation. For example, a script that clones a git repo doesn't exist to clone a git repo. It exists to download the source code that does something. Your description of the Action should explain what the script is doing with the source code that it downloads with as much detail as you can infer from the provided file contents.\n\n# SourceFile\nYou will be provided with the contents of the file to analyze as well as its dependencies to help you understand what the file is doing.\nIf you are missing a module in the bicep file, use fs_read_file to add the module to the prompt. Ignore .json and .jsonc file references.\n\nIn Bicep, you can use the following syntax to include a module in your file (for example policy-definition.bicep):\n\n\\`\\`\\`bicep\nmodule policyDefinition 'policy-definition.bicep' = ...\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n### Source File Guidance\nWhen you generate the JSON response, you will need to include the file path from the file that generated the action or issue in the SourceFile fields.\n\n# Task\n1. Review the Azure file and its dependencies that the user uploads\n2. Perform a very careful analysis of all the file contents that you receive to really understand what is happening\n3. Develop a lengthy list of actions that are being performed by the file and its dependencies. Make sure that you understand what is being done and why it is being done in creating this list using the approach from \"Guidance on Actions\" above.\n4. Double check your list of actions to make sure that you have a complete list of actions and add any that you missed\n5. Organize the actions by the target services or cloud components that are impacted by the actions\n6. Identify any cloud resources that are deployed after this file is used that were not present before this file was used and add them to the \"Deployed\" list. If nothing that you find directly within the provided file content meets this criteria, please leave the list empty.\n7.

for an enterprise software company. The user will share a file and its dependencies for you to analyze.\n\n# Objective\nDetermine what actions the SPEC files will take on Azure and identify the target services or cloud components impacted.\n\n# Definitions\n## Action\nSomething being done by the SPEC file or its dependencies when used. Understanding the Action requires understanding the purpose of the script and its dependencies which requires deeper analysis than just describing the basic implementation of the name or steps in the script. The Action is the *why* of the script, not the *how*.\n\n## Target\nSpecific Azure service or cloud component that will be impacted by the Action. Example Targets include Application Insights, Application Gateway, Virtual Machines, and GitHub but could even include other clouds or custom components.\n\n## Deployed\nAny cloud resource that is deployed after this file is used that was not present before this file was used. Cloud resources that were already deployed before this file was used are not considered Deployed, and any cloud resources that are *always* deleted after this file is used are not considered Deployed.\n\n# Guidance on Actions\nIt is important to explain *why* the Action is being taken and *what* is being done in your description of the Action. Describing the purpose of the Action requires that you understand the value of the performed step. When you write the description of the Action, you should explain *why* and *what* is being done rather than just describing the implementation. For example, a script that clones a git repo doesn't exist to clone a git repo. It exists to download the source code that does something. Your description of the Action should explain what the script is doing with the source code that it downloads with as much detail as you can infer from the provided file contents.\n\n# SourceFile\nYou will be provided with the contents of the file to analyze as well as its dependencies to help you understand what the file is doing.\nIf you are missing a module in the bicep file, use fs_read_file to add the module to the prompt. Ignore .json and .jsonc file references.\n\nIn Bicep, you can use the following syntax to include a module in your file (for example policy-definition.bicep):\n\n```bicep\nmodule policyDefinition 'policy-definition.bicep' = ...\n```\n\n### Source File Guidance\nWhen you generate the JSON response, you will need to include the file path from the file that generated the action or issue in the SourceFile fields.\n\n# Task\n1. Review the Azure file and its dependencies that the user uploads\n2. Perform a very careful analysis of all the file contents that you receive to really understand what is happening\n3. Develop a lengthy list of actions that are being performed by the file and its dependencies. Make sure that you understand what is being done and why it is being done in creating this list using the approach from \"Guidance on Actions\" above.\n4. Double check your list of actions to make sure that you have a complete list of actions and add any that you missed\n5. Organize the actions by the target services or cloud components that are impacted by the actions\n6. Identify any cloud resources that are deployed after this file is used that were not present before this file was used and add them to the \"Deployed\" list. If nothing that you find directly within the provided file content meets this criteria, please leave the list empty.\n7. Return a JSON object using the following format\n## Response format\n```json\n{\n    \"Targets\": {\n        \"Target1\": [\n            {\n                \"SourceFile\": \"file path of the file that

Understanding the Action requires understanding the purpose of the script and its dependencies which requires deeper analysis than just describing the basic implementation of the name or steps in the script. The Action is the *why* of the script, not the *how*.\n\n### Target\nSpecific Azure service or cloud component that will be impacted by the Action. Example Targets include Application Insights, Application Gateway, Virtual Machines, and GitHub but could even include other clouds or custom components.\n\n### Deployed\nAny cloud resource that is deployed after this file is used that was not present before this file was used. Cloud resources that were already deployed before this file was used are not considered Deployed, and any cloud resources that are *always* deleted after this file is used are not considered Deployed.\n\n## Guidance on Actions\nIt is important to explain *why* the Action is being taken and *what* is being done in your description of the Action. Describing the purpose of the Action requires that you understand the value of the performed step. When you write the description of the Action, you should explain *why* and *what* is being done rather than just describing the implementation. For example, a script that clones a git repo doesn't exist to clone a git repo. It exists to download the source code that does something. Your description of the Action should explain what the script is doing with the source code that it downloads with as much detail as you can infer from the provided file contents.\n\n\n## Task 1\n\nIdentify security issues in SPECS files. Examine each SPECS file carefully.\nUse ANNOTATIONS to highlight the issues, best practices or improvements in SPECS. \n\n-  Look for bad practices.\n-  Look for weak secrets and passwords\n-  Look for any pattern that would to a security issue.\n-  Add link to documentation about security issues.\n-  Do NOT generate annotations for DEPS files.\n-  Do NOT generate a bullet point list.\n-  Do NOT report notice annotations, only error and warning.\n\n## Task 2\n\n1. Review the SPECS files and its dependencies that the user uploads\n2. Perform a very careful analysis of all the file contents that you receive to really understand what is happening\n3. Develop a lengthy list of actions that are being performed by the file and its dependencies. Make sure that you understand what is being done and why it is being done in creating this list using the approach from \"Guidance on Actions\" above.\n4. Double check your list of actions to make sure that you have a complete list of actions and add any that you missed\n5. Organize the actions by the target services or cloud components that are impacted by the actions\n6. Identify any cloud resources that are deployed after this file is used that were not present before this file was used and add them to the \"Deployed\" list. If nothing that you find directly within the provided file content meets this criteria, please leave the list empty.\n7.

Understanding the Action requires understanding the purpose of the script and its dependencies which requires deeper analysis than just describing the basic implementation of the name or steps in the script. The Action is the *why* of the script, not the *how*.\n\n### Target\nSpecific Azure service or cloud component that will be impacted by the Action. Example Targets include Application Insights, Application Gateway, Virtual Machines, and GitHub but could even include other clouds or custom components.\n\n### Deployed\nAny cloud resource that is deployed after this file is used that was not present before this file was used. Cloud resources that were already deployed before this file was used are not considered Deployed, and any cloud resources that are *always* deleted after this file is used are not considered Deployed.\n\n## Guidance on Actions\nIt is important to explain *why* the Action is being taken and *what* is being done in your description of the Action. Describing the purpose of the Action requires that you understand the value of the performed step. When you write the description of the Action, you should explain *why* and *what* is being done rather than just describing the implementation. For example, a script that clones a git repo doesn't exist to clone a git repo. It exists to download the source code that does something. Your description of the Action should explain what the script is doing with the source code that it downloads with as much detail as you can infer from the provided file contents.\n\n\n## Task 1\n\nIdentify security issues in SPECS files. Examine each SPECS file carefully.\nUse ANNOTATIONS to highlight the issues, best practices or improvements in SPECS. \n\n-  Look for bad practices.\n-  Look for weak secrets and passwords\n-  Look for any pattern that would to a security issue.\n-  Add link to documentation about security issues.\n-  Do NOT generate annotations for DEPS files.\n-  Do NOT generate a bullet point list.\n-  Do NOT report notice annotations, only error and warning.\n\n## Task 2\n\n1. Review the SPECS files and its dependencies that the user uploads\n2. Perform a very careful analysis of all the file contents that you receive to really understand what is happening\n3. Develop a lengthy list of actions that are being performed by the file and its dependencies. Make sure that you understand what is being done and why it is being done in creating this list using the approach from \"Guidance on Actions\" above.\n4. Double check your list of actions to make sure that you have a complete list of actions and add any that you missed\n5. Organize the actions by the target services or cloud components that are impacted by the actions\n6. Identify any cloud resources that are deployed after this file is used that were not present before this file was used and add them to the \"Deployed\" list. If nothing that you find directly within the provided file content meets this criteria, please leave the list empty.\n7. Generate a JSON file, targets.json, with the results following the TARGET_SCHEMA JSON schema:\n`\n\ndefSchema(\"TARGET_SCHEMA\", {\n  type: \"array\",\n  description: \"An array of targets\",\n  items: {\n    description: \"A target that is impacted by the actions in the file\",\n    type: \"object\",\n    properties: {\n      \"name\": {\n        \"description\": \"Identifier of the target\",\n        type: \"string\"\n      },\n      \"source\": {\n        \"description\": \"Path of the file defining the target\",\n        type: \"string\"\n      },\n      \"action\": {\n        \"description\": \"What is being done on the cloud resource\",\n        type: \"string\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<details id=\"expanded-prompt\" class=\"gptools\"><summary>\nexpanded prompt\n</summary>\n\n-   model: `gpt-4`\n-   temperature: 0.2\n\n``````markdown\n# Context\n\nYou are a Azure Bicep language expert.\nYou will analyze the contents of SPEC files \nfrom a git repository of a Microsoft Azure Landing Zone Accelerator (LZA) \nfor an enterprise software company.\n\n## Files\n\nSPECS:\n```bicep file=aca-landing-zone-accelerator/scenarios/aca-internal/bicep/modules/02-spoke/deploy.spoke.bicep\n[1] targetScope = 'subscription'\n[2] \n[3] // ------------------\n[4] //    PARAMETERS\n[5] // ------------------\n[6] \n[7] @description('The name of the workload that is being deployed.

Understanding the Action requires understanding the purpose of the script and its dependencies which requires deeper analysis than just describing the basic implementation of the name or steps in the script. The Action is the *why* of the script, not the *how*.\n\n### Target\nSpecific Azure service or cloud component that will be impacted by the Action. Example Targets include Application Insights, Application Gateway, Virtual Machines, and GitHub but could even include other clouds or custom components.\n\n### Deployed\nAny cloud resource that is deployed after this file is used that was not present before this file was used. Cloud resources that were already deployed before this file was used are not considered Deployed, and any cloud resources that are *always* deleted after this file is used are not considered Deployed.\n\n## Guidance on Actions\nIt is important to explain *why* the Action is being taken and *what* is being done in your description of the Action. Describing the purpose of the Action requires that you understand the value of the performed step. When you write the description of the Action, you should explain *why* and *what* is being done rather than just describing the implementation. For example, a script that clones a git repo doesn't exist to clone a git repo. It exists to download the source code that does something. Your description of the Action should explain what the script is doing with the source code that it downloads with as much detail as you can infer from the provided file contents.\n\n\n## Task 1\n\nIdentify security issues in SPECS files. Examine each SPECS file carefully.\nUse ANNOTATIONS to highlight the issues, best practices or improvements in SPECS. \n\n-  Look for bad practices.\n-  Look for weak secrets and passwords\n-  Look for any pattern that would to a security issue.\n-  Add link to documentation about security issues.\n-  Do NOT generate annotations for DEPS files.\n-  Do NOT generate a bullet point list.\n-  Do NOT report notice annotations, only error and warning.\n\n## Task 2\n\n1. Review the SPECS files and its dependencies that the user uploads\n2. Perform a very careful analysis of all the file contents that you receive to really understand what is happening\n3. Develop a lengthy list of actions that are being performed by the file and its dependencies. Make sure that you understand what is being done and why it is being done in creating this list using the approach from \"Guidance on Actions\" above.\n4. Double check your list of actions to make sure that you have a complete list of actions and add any that you missed\n5. Organize the actions by the target services or cloud components that are impacted by the actions\n6. Identify any cloud resources that are deployed after this file is used that were not present before this file was used and add them to the \"Deployed\" list. If nothing that you find directly within the provided file content meets this criteria, please leave the list empty.\n7. Generate a JSON file, targets.json, with the results following the TARGET_SCHEMA JSON schema:\n\nTARGET_SCHEMA:\n```\n{\n  \"type\": \"array\",\n  \"description\": \"An array of targets\",\n  \"items\": {\n    \"description\": \"A target that is impacted by the actions in the file\",\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"name\": {\n        \"description\": \"Identifier of the target\",\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"source\": {\n        \"description\": \"Path of the file defining the target\",\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"action\": {\n        \"description\": \"What is being done on the cloud resource\",\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n``````\n\n</details>\n\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<details id=\"🧠-llm-request-(2-messages)\" class=\"gptools\"><summary>\n🧠 llm request (2 messages)\n</summary>\n\n-   OpenAI chat request\n-   model: gpt-4\n-   url: [https://tnrllmproxy.azurewebsites.net/openai/deployments/gpt-4/chat/completions?api-version=2023-09-01-preview](https://tnrllmproxy.azurewebsites.net/openai/deployments/gpt-4/chat/completions?api-version=2023-09-01-preview)\n-   response: 200 OK\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<details id=\"📩-llm-response\" class=\"gptools\"><summary>\n📩 llm response\n</summary>\n\n## Task 1 Annotations\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> Hardcoded credentials are a security risk.

The spoke architecture is a part of a larger hub-and-spoke network topology, which is commonly used in enterprise environments to manage network traffic and provide security boundaries between different workloads.\n\nThe SPECS file performs the following actions:\n\n- **Resource Group Creation**: A new resource group is created or an existing name is used based on the provided parameters. This resource group serves as a container for all resources related to the spoke.\n- **Naming Convention Application**: A naming module is used to apply consistent naming conventions across all resources.\n- **Virtual Network (VNet) Setup**: A virtual network is set up with subnets for infrastructure, private endpoints, application gateway, and optionally a jump box, depending on the parameters provided.\n- **Network Security Groups (NSG) Configuration**: NSGs are defined and associated with the subnets to control inbound and outbound network traffic.\n- **Log Analytics Workspace Deployment**: A workspace is deployed for logging and monitoring of the resources within the spoke.\n- **Peering Configuration**: Network peering is established between the spoke and hub virtual networks, allowing for secure communication between them.\n- **Conditional Resource Deployment**: Depending on the parameters, optional resources such as an Application Gateway, jump box VMs (Linux or Windows), and policy assignments are deployed.\n- **Policy Assignments**: Azure policies are assigned to enforce best practices and compliance within the spoke subscription.\n\nThe dependencies `linux-vm.bicep` and `windows-vm.bicep` define the deployment of Linux and Windows virtual machines, respectively, which can be used as jump boxes for secure administrative access to the spoke environment.\n\nThe dependency `policy-definition.module.bicep` defines the assignment of built-in and custom Azure policies to the spoke subscription, focusing on security and compliance for Azure Container Apps.\n\n### Deployed\n\nThe following resources are deployed by the SPECS file:\n\n- Resource Group\n- Virtual Network with subnets\n- Network Security Groups\n- Log Analytics Workspace\n- Virtual Machines (conditional)\n- Azure Policy Assignments\n\n### targets.json Generation\n\nFile ./targets.json:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Resource Group\",\n    \"source\":

The spoke architecture is a part of a larger hub-and-spoke network topology, which is commonly used in enterprise environments to manage network traffic and provide security boundaries between different workloads.\n\nThe SPECS file performs the following actions:\n\n- **Resource Group Creation**: A new resource group is created or an existing name is used based on the provided parameters. This resource group serves as a container for all resources related to the spoke.\n- **Naming Convention Application**: A naming module is used to apply consistent naming conventions across all resources.\n- **Virtual Network (VNet) Setup**: A virtual network is set up with subnets for infrastructure, private endpoints, application gateway, and optionally a jump box, depending on the parameters provided.\n- **Network Security Groups (NSG) Configuration**: NSGs are defined and associated with the subnets to control inbound and outbound network traffic.\n- **Log Analytics Workspace Deployment**: A workspace is deployed for logging and monitoring of the resources within the spoke.\n- **Peering Configuration**: Network peering is established between the spoke and hub virtual networks, allowing for secure communication between them.\n- **Conditional Resource Deployment**: Depending on the parameters, optional resources such as an Application Gateway, jump box VMs (Linux or Windows), and policy assignments are deployed.\n- **Policy Assignments**: Azure policies are assigned to enforce best practices and compliance within the spoke subscription.\n\nThe dependencies `linux-vm.bicep` and `windows-vm.bicep` define the deployment of Linux and Windows virtual machines, respectively, which can be used as jump boxes for secure administrative access to the spoke environment.\n\nThe dependency `policy-definition.module.bicep` defines the assignment of built-in and custom Azure policies to the spoke subscription, focusing on security and compliance for Azure Container Apps.\n\n### Deployed\n\nThe following resources are deployed by the SPECS file:\n\n- Resource Group\n- Virtual Network with subnets\n- Network Security Groups\n- Log Analytics Workspace\n- Virtual Machines (conditional)\n- Azure Policy Assignments\n\n### targets.json Generation\n\nFile ./targets.json:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Resource Group\",\n    \"source\": \"deploy.spoke.bicep\",\n    \"action\": \"A new resource group is created to contain all resources related to the spoke, providing a management boundary.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Virtual Network\",\n    \"source\": \"deploy.spoke.bicep\",\n    \"action\": \"A virtual network is set up with various subnets to support the infrastructure, private endpoints, and application gateway, facilitating network segmentation and traffic management.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Network Security Groups\",\n    \"source\": \"deploy.spoke.bicep\",\n    \"action\": \"Network Security Groups are configured for each subnet to control inbound and outbound network traffic, enhancing security.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Log Analytics Workspace\",\n    \"source\": \"deploy.spoke.bicep\",\n    \"action\": \"A Log Analytics Workspace is deployed for centralized logging and monitoring of the spoke resources.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Virtual Machines\",\n    \"source\": \"deploy.spoke.bicep\",\n    \"action\": \"Conditional deployment of Linux or Windows virtual machines to act as jump boxes for secure administrative access.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Azure Policy Assignments\",\n    \"source\": \"deploy.spoke.bicep\",\n    \"action\": \"Azure policies are assigned to enforce security best practices and compliance within the spoke subscription.\"\n  }\n]\n```"}}}

Understanding the Action requires understanding the purpose of the script and its dependencies which requires deeper analysis than just describing the basic implementation of the name or steps in the script. The Action is the *why* of the script, not the *how*.\n\n### Target\nSpecific Azure service or cloud component that will be impacted by the Action. Example Targets include Application Insights, Application Gateway, Virtual Machines, and GitHub but could even include other clouds or custom components.\n\n### Deployed\nAny cloud resource that is deployed after this file is used that was not present before this file was used. Cloud resources that were already deployed before this file was used are not considered Deployed, and any cloud resources that are *always* deleted after this file is used are not considered Deployed.\n\n## Guidance on Actions\nIt is important to explain *why* the Action is being taken and *what* is being done in your description of the Action. Describing the purpose of the Action requires that you understand the value of the performed step. When you write the description of the Action, you should explain *why* and *what* is being done rather than just describing the implementation. For example, a script that clones a git repo doesn't exist to clone a git repo. It exists to download the source code that does something. Your description of the Action should explain what the script is doing with the source code that it downloads with as much detail as you can infer from the provided file contents.\n\n\n## Task 1\n\nIdentify security issues in SPECS files. Examine each SPECS file carefully.\nUse ANNOTATIONS to highlight the issues, best practices or improvements in SPECS. \n\n-  Look for bad practices.\n-  Look for weak secrets and passwords\n-  Look for any pattern that would to a security issue.\n-  Add link to documentation about security issues.\n-  Do NOT generate annotations for DEPS files.\n-  Do NOT generate a bullet point list.\n-  Do NOT report notice annotations, only error and warning.\n\n## Task 2\n\n1. Review the SPECS files and its dependencies that the user uploads\n2. Perform a very careful analysis of all the file contents that you receive to really understand what is happening\n3. Develop a lengthy list of actions that are being performed by the file and its dependencies. Make sure that you understand what is being done and why it is being done in creating this list using the approach from \"Guidance on Actions\" above.\n4. Double check your list of actions to make sure that you have a complete list of actions and add any that you missed\n5. Organize the actions by the target services or cloud components that are impacted by the actions\n6. Identify any cloud resources that are deployed after this file is used that were not present before this file was used and add them to the \"Deployed\" list. If nothing that you find directly within the provided file content meets this criteria, please leave the list empty.\n7.

Cloud resources that were already deployed before this file was used are not considered Deployed, and any cloud resources that are *always* deleted after this file is used are not considered Deployed.\n\n## Guidance on Actions\nIt is important to explain *why* the Action is being taken and *what* is being done in your description of the Action. Describing the purpose of the Action requires that you understand the value of the performed step. When you write the description of the Action, you should explain *why* and *what* is being done rather than just describing the implementation. For example, a script that clones a git repo doesn't exist to clone a git repo. It exists to download the source code that does something. Your description of the Action should explain what the script is doing with the source code that it downloads with as much detail as you can infer from the provided file contents.\n\n\n## Task 1\n\nIdentify security issues in SPECS files. Examine each SPECS file carefully.\nUse ANNOTATIONS to highlight the issues, best practices or improvements in SPECS. \n\n-  Look for bad practices.\n-  Look for weak secrets and passwords\n-  Look for any pattern that would to a security issue.\n-  Add link to documentation about security issues.\n-  Do NOT generate annotations for DEPS files.\n-  Do NOT generate a bullet point list.\n-  Do NOT report notice annotations, only error and warning.\n\n## Task 2\n\n1. Review the SPECS files and its dependencies that the user uploads\n2. Perform a very careful analysis of all the file contents that you receive to really understand what is happening\n3. Develop a lengthy list of actions that are being performed by the file and its dependencies. Make sure that you understand what is being done and why it is being done in creating this list using the approach from \"Guidance on Actions\" above.\n4. Double check your list of actions to make sure that you have a complete list of actions and add any that you missed\n5. Organize the actions by the target services or cloud components that are impacted by the actions\n6. Identify any cloud resources that are deployed after this file is used that were not present before this file was used and add them to the \"Deployed\" list. If nothing that you find directly within the provided file content meets this criteria, please leave the list empty.\n7. Generate a YAML file, targets.yaml, with the results following the TARGET_SCHEMA JSON schema:\n\nTARGET_SCHEMA:\n```\n{\n  \"type\": \"array\",\n  \"description\": \"An array of targets\",\n  \"items\": {\n    \"description\": \"A target that is impacted by the actions in the file\",\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"name\": {\n        \"description\": \"Identifier of the target\",\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"source\": {\n        \"description\": \"Path of the file defining the target\",\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"action\": {\n        \"description\": \"What is being done on the cloud resource\",\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n``````\n\n</details>\n\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<details id=\"🧠-llm-request-(2-messages)\" class=\"gptools\"><summary>\n🧠 llm request (2 messages)\n</summary>\n\n-   OpenAI chat request\n-   model: gpt-4\n-   url: [https://tnrllmproxy.azurewebsites.net/openai/deployments/gpt-4/chat/completions?api-version=2023-09-01-preview](https://tnrllmproxy.azurewebsites.net/openai/deployments/gpt-4/chat/completions?api-version=2023-09-01-preview)\n-   response: 200 OK\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<details id=\"📩-llm-response\" class=\"gptools\"><summary>\n📩 llm response\n</summary>\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> Sensitive information such as passwords should not be included in plain text in Bicep files.

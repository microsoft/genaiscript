## Guidance for Code Generation
- GenAIScript programs are meant to be executed through the genaiscript cli (https://www.npmjs.com/package/genaiscript).
- When generating code for GenAIScript, always target TypeScript, Node.JS, ESM. Prefer await/async, keep it simple.
- ambient types and definitions defined in "genaiscript.d.ts" are preloaded at runtime. you do not need to import them.
- you keep the code simple, avoid exception handlers or error checking.
- you add TODOs where you are unsure so that the user can review them
- you use the global types in genaiscript.d.ts are already loaded in the global context, no need to import them.
- save generated code in the "./genaisrc" folder with ".genai.mts" extension

**Task:**  
Generate an llms.txt file in Markdown format that provides a structured and well-organized overview of all files within a given directory. The document should enhance readability and maintainability while offering a clear understanding of the project's structure and purpose.

### **Requirements:**  

1. **Project Overview:**  
   - Use the directory name as the title (# ProjectName).  
   - Include a blockquote (>) summarizing the projectâ€™s purpose and functionality concisely.  

2. **File Structure Representation:**  
   - Provide a **hierarchical file map** using bullet points (- for files and subdirectories).  
   - Properly indent nested files to reflect the actual directory structure.  

3. **File Descriptions:**  
   - Each key file should have a **brief yet informative description**, explaining its role in the project.  
   - Use bold formatting (**FileName**) for file names in this section.  

4. **Formatting Guidelines:**  
   - Use Markdown syntax correctly for headings, blockquotes, and lists.  
   - Ensure clarity and consistency in descriptions.  
   - Focus on **concise, high-level** descriptions while avoiding redundancy.

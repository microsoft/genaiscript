# Description Create a command line blackjack application 

## Idea

Create a command line application that allows users to play blackjack with it. It should allow the user to place a bet, be dealt multiple hands, and finally quit. Implement the blackjack dealer by always standing on 17 and above and drawing on anything less. The program should handle how much money the player has and print out the actions of the dealer and how much money the player has after each round.

## Tasks

### Software Architect (SA)

1. Design a modular architecture for the command line blackjack application.
2. Identify the main components, such as user input handling, game logic, and output formatting.
3. Define clear APIs for each component to interact with each other.
4. Ensure the architecture supports the game rules and requirements specified in the Idea section.

### Software Developer (SDE)

1. Implement the code for each component based on the APIs and architecture provided by the SA.
2. Ensure the user can place bets, be dealt multiple hands, and quit the game.
3. Implement the blackjack dealer logic, standing on 17 and above, and drawing on anything less.
4. Handle the player's money and display the dealer's actions and player's money after each round.

### Quality Assurance Engineer (QA)

1. Write test cases to verify the correctness of the command line blackjack application.
2. Test the user input handling, game logic, and output formatting components.
3. Validate the dealer's actions and player's money management according to the game rules.
4. Ensure the application meets the requirements specified in the Idea section.

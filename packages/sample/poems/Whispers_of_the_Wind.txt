Whispers of the wind in the twilight hour,
Dancing leaves and blooming flower.
Soft murmurs through the ancient trees,
Nature's serenade, a gentle breeze.

Stars awaken in the night sky,
Glimmering softly, they catch the eye.
Moonlight weaves a silver thread,
Across the earth, where dreams are spread.

Silent echoes of the night,
Crickets sing in pure delight.
A symphony of peace and grace,
In the quiet, nature's embrace.

Morning dew on petals bright,
Glistening in the dawning light.
A new day begins, with hopes anew,
In the heart of nature, pure and true.

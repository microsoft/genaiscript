The document "src/rag/markdown.md" is an introduction to Markdown, a lightweight markup language created by John Gruber in 2004. Markdown allows users to add formatting to plain text documents using specific syntax as opposed to the immediate visual formatting seen in WYSIWYG editors like Microsoft Word. For example, a heading is created by adding a number sign before the text (e.g., # Heading One), and bold text is formatted by placing two asterisks around the phrase (e.g., **this text is bold**). The document describes how Markdown may seem unusual for those used to traditional word processing applications, but it is a widely used and simple way to format text.

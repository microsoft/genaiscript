Markdown is a lightweight markup language created by John Gruber in 2004. It is used to add formatting elements to plain text documents and is popular globally. Unlike WYSIWYG editors like Microsoft Word, which provide immediate visual feedback through a graphical interface, Markdown requires adding specific syntax to the text to indicate formatting. For example, a heading is denoted by adding a number sign (#) before the text, and bold text is surrounded by two asterisks (**). Beginners may find it takes some time to become accustomed to reading and writing Markdown syntax, especially if they have experience with visual text editors. The document provides an example file displayed in the Visual Studio Code editor.

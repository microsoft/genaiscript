Markdown is a lightweight markup language created by John Gruber in 2004, and it is widely used to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Unlike WYSIWYG editors, using Markdown involves adding Markdown syntax to the text to indicate formatting, such as adding a number sign before a heading or two asterisks before and after a phrase to make it bold. This may require some adjustment for those accustomed to WYSIWYG applications.

Markdown is a lightweight markup language created by John Gruber in 2004. It is widely used to add formatting elements to plaintext documents. Unlike WYSIWYG editors, Markdown requires users to add specific syntax to indicate formatting, such as using a number sign for headings (#) and double asterisks for bold text (**). The transition from WYSIWYG applications to Markdown syntax may take some adjustment.

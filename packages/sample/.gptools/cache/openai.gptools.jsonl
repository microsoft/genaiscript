The framework leverages foundation models (specifically LLMs) to enable a new kind of scripting that combines traditional code and natural language.\n\n> Don't forget to turn on the sound.\n\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/gptools/assets/4175913/74517b81-4b9c-47d9-8a5c-a15362b0d4db\n\n## Key Objectives and Technical Elements\n\nThe main objectives of gptools are to improve automation, collaboration, and accessibility in the creation, understanding, and maintenance of complex GPT artifacts.\nThe key elements of the gptools framework are:\n\n-   [gptools](./docs/gptools.md): Scripts that integrate traditional code and natural language, leveraging foundation models in their execution.\n-   [gpspecs](./docs/gpspecs.md): Natural language documents that instantiate gptools in a particular context.\n-   [VS Code extension](./packages/vscode/README.md): Supporting seamless user interaction with gptools.\n-   **gpvm**: A framework and runtime system that executes gpspecs and gptools.\n\nGPTools access AI foundation models (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Llama, ...) using a [user-provided token](./docs/token.md).\n\n## Install manually\n\nThese are the instructions to install the latest build of the extension manually in Visual Studio Code.\n\n-   open the [latest release](https://github.com/microsoft/gptools/releases/latest/),\n-   download the `gptools.vsix` file\n-   open Visual Studio Code\n-   open the command palette and type **Extensions: Install from VSIX...**\n-   load the `gptools.vsix` file\n\nUntil this extension is in the Marketplace, you will have to repeat these steps each time you want to upgrade the extension.\n\n### GPTool scripts\n\nGPTool scripts use stylized JavaScript with minimal syntax. They are stored as files (`gptools/*.gptool.js`) in your project.\n\n```js\ngptool({\n    title: \"Technical proofreading\",\n    description: \"Reviews the text as a technical document writer.\",\n})\n\ndef(\"TEXT\", env.file)\n\n$`You are reviewing and updating TEXT to fix grammatical errors, fix spelling errors and make it technical.`\n```\n\nGPTools comes with builtin tools and allows you to fork and customize the AI prompts to your project specific needs.\nThis leverages VSCode language support (completion, coloring, error checking)\nwhile remaining friendly to people not very familiar with JavaScript.\nGPTools also provides detailed expansion logs to help you debug your templates.\n\nSince gptool scripts are stored as files in the project, they can be shared, versioned, collaborated on by the entire development team\nusing the existing team development cycle.\n\nIn the future, we foresee that developers will create libraries of gptools and share them as libraries on their favorite package manager.\n\n-   [Read more about gptools](./docs/gptools.md).\n\n## GPSpec specifications\n\nNatural language documents that instantiate gptools in a particular context. GPTools parses `*.gpspec.md` markdown files as specification.\n\n```markdown A sample GPSpec document.\n# email address recognizer\n\nWrite a function that takes a string argument\nand returns true if the whole string is a valid email address, false otherwise.\n```\n\n-   [Read more about gpspecs](./docs/gpspecs.md).\n\n## User experience\n\nThis diagram demonstrates the AI-enhanced workflow process in gptools.

GPTools uses LLMs to enable a new kind of scripting that combines traditional code and natural language.\n\n> Don't forget to turn on the sound.\n\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/gptools/assets/4175913/74517b81-4b9c-47d9-8a5c-a15362b0d4db\n\n## Key Objectives and Technical Elements\n\nThe main objectives of gptools are to improve automation, collaboration, and accessibility in the creation, understanding, and maintenance of complex GPT artifacts. The key elements of the gptools framework are:\n\n-   [gptools](./docs/gptools.md): Scripts that integrate traditional code and natural language, leveraging foundation models in their execution.\n-   [gpspecs](./docs/gpspecs.md): Natural language documents that instantiate gptools in a particular context.\n-   [VS Code extension](./packages/vscode/README.md): Supporting seamless user interaction with gptools.\n-   **gpvm**: A framework and runtime system that executes gpspecs and gptools.\n\nGPTools uses hosted AI foundation models (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Llama, ...) using a [user-provided token](./docs/token.md).\n\n### GPTool scripts\n\nGPTool scripts use stylized JavaScript with minimal syntax. They are stored as files (`gptools/*.gptool.js`) in your project.\n\n```js\ngptool({\n    title: \"Technical proofreading\",\n    description: \"Reviews the text as a tech writer.\",\n})\n\ndef(\"TEXT\", env.file)\n\n$`You are reviewing and updating TEXT \nto fix grammatical errors, \nfix spelling errors and make it technical.`\n```\n\nGPTools comes with builtin tools and allows you to fork and customize the AI prompts to your project specific needs.\nThis leverages VSCode language support (completion, coloring, error checking)\nwhile remaining friendly to people not very familiar with JavaScript.\nGPTools also provides detailed expansion logs to help you debug your templates.\n\nSince gptool scripts are stored as files in the project, they can be shared, versioned, collaborated on by the entire development team\nusing the existing team development cycle.\n\nIn the future, we foresee that developers will create libraries of gptools and share them as libraries on their favorite package manager.\n\n-   [Read more about gptools](./docs/gptools.md).\n\n## GPSpec specifications\n\nNatural language documents that instantiate gptools in a particular context. GPTools parses `*.gpspec.md` markdown files as specification.

The gpspec starts the `gptool`, which reads the `gpspec`, interacts with the gpvm and foundation model.\nThe AI-generated output is used to update the workspace, and the user interacts with the updated workspace through the gptools extension to VS code.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\nparticipant User\nparticipant VSCode\nparticipant gpspec\nparticipant gptool\nparticipant gpvm\nUser->>VSCode: Create/Edit gpspec\nVSCode->>gpspec: Save gpspec\nUser->>VSCode: Invoke gptool\nVSCode->>gptool: Execute gptool with gpspec + workspace\ngptool->>gpvm: Request foundation model execution\ngpvm->>gptool: Return AI-generated output\ngptool->>VSCode: Update workspace with output\nVSCode->>User: Display updated workspace\n```\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Install in Visual Studio Code\n\nThese are the instructions to install the latest build of the extension manually in Visual Studio Code.\n\n-   install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)\n-   open the [latest release](https://github.com/microsoft/gptools/releases/latest/),\n-   download the `gptools.vsix` file\n-   open Visual Studio Code\n-   open the command palette and type **Extensions: Install from VSIX...**\n-   load the `gptools.vsix` file\n\nUntil this extension is in the Marketplace, you will have to repeat these steps each time you want to upgrade the extension.\n\n### Try a builtin tool\n\nGPTools comes with sample tools and you don't need a gpspec to run those tools on any file. The easiest way to start playing with GPTools is to:\n\n-   open a folder in Visual Studio Code\n-   open any file, open the context menu and run \"Run GPTool...\"\n-   select one of the builtin tools in the dropdown\n\n### Create a gpspec\n\nThe default gpspec generated by GPTools is rather simplistic.

We'll start by opening the GP spec file, which is a markdown file where we describe the task to do. In this example, we're going to implement an email validator.\n[2] \n[3] Nancy: That's right, Ethan. The task is to write a function that takes a string and validates if the whole string is a valid email address. This description is in natural language, in what we call the GP spec file.\n[4] \n[5] Ethan: Now, this GP spec file is run against a GP tool. The GP tools are JavaScript files defined in the project. Let's open the generate python GP tool, which has some metadata used to populate the UI, a programmatic way to access the context, and the typical prompt engineering using an intuitive syntax.\n[6] \n[7] Nancy: From the user's perspective, they can take the code action tool and select the \"generate python code\" option. This will execute the GP tool against the GP spec and the rest of the context. The results are streamed in Visual Studio Code and previewed as a refactoring.\n[8] \n[9] Ethan: That's right. We can see that a new file is parsed out, and an update to the file is made. If the user is happy with the changes, they can apply them just like any other refactoring. Next, they can run the test generation tool, which is another JavaScript file in the project.\n[10] \n[11] Nancy: When running the test generation tool, we can see that it generates tests but uses the wrong framework. To fix this, the team can update the tool file. After updating the file, they can run the test tool again, and now it picks up the right test framework.\n[12] \n[13] Ethan: Once the tests are generated, they can make sure the tests are passing. Now, let's say the customer changes their mind and decides that the function should also validate URLs. The user can update the spec to reflect this change and run the tool again.\n[14] \n[15] Nancy: When running the tool again, it initially uses the wrong file. The user can refine the spec to use the same pipeline file, run the tool again, and now it regenerates the email validator. They can review the changes and apply them if they're satisfied.\n[16] \n[17] Ethan: And that's it!

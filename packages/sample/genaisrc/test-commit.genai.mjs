# Task 1

Review the code changes in GIT_DIFF and summarize the changes. Keep it short.

# Task 2

For each test in TESTS, assign a validation score between
    - low: The test is not impacted by the changes in GIT_DIFF.
    - medium: The test may be impacted by the changes in GIT_DIFF.
    - high: The test is most likely impacted by the changes in GIT_DIFF.

Report each test, the score and the reason for the score.

# Task 3

Select the most impacted 8 tests.
Avoid duplicates.

# Task 4

Report the selected tests as a line-separated list of filenames 
in file "temp/commit-tests.txt".
Remove the .genai.js extension.

    File temp/commit-tests.txt:
    \`\`\`text
    test filename 1
    test filename 2
    ...
    \`\`\`

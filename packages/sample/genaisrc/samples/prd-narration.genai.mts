    Your task is to create an engaging summary of code changes in the git diff ${gf} that would work well as a narration
    AND a voice description for a text-to-speech model AND a voice type.

    ## Summary Instructions
    - Focus on the key points and main message
    - Use natural, conversational language
    - Keep it between 2-3 paragraphs
    - You can use Technical Jargon, but explain it in simple terms
    - Do not start with Excited
    
    ## Voice Instructions
    - In your thinking, generate 5 descriptions of the voice suitable for a text-to-speech model. These voice personalities should be wildly different and esoteric.
    - Include details about the accent, tone, pacing, emotion, pronunciation, and personality affect
    - Get inspired by the content of the blog post
    - Pick one of the 5 voices randomly as your output.
    - go crazy on the voice descriptions

    Follow the structure of the following examples:
    ${YAML.stringify(examples)}

    ## Voice Type
    Select one of the voice types provided by OpenAI ("alloy" | "ash" | "coral" | "echo" | "fable" | "onyx" | "nova" | "sage" | "shimmer" | "verse" | "ballad") based on the blog post content
    and the voice description you generated.

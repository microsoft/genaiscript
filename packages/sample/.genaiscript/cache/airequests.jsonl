Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.  Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.  For example, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., **this text is bold**). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you’re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications.\n`````\n\nPDF:\n```pdf file=src/rag/Lorem Ipsum.pdf\nat Hampden -Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one o f the more obscure Latin words,  consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical  literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and  1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malor um\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written  in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The  first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you’re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications.\n"}},"trace":"## rag\n\n\n\n<details id=\"🤖-automation\" class=\"genaiscript\"><summary>\n🤖 automation\n</summary>\n\nThis operation can be run from the command line:\n\n```bash\nnode .genaiscript/genaiscript.js run rag src/rag/dir --apply-edits\n```\n\n-   You will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).\n-   Configure the OpenAI token in environment variables (run `node .genaiscript/genaiscript help keys` for help).\n-   The `.genaiscript/genaiscript.js` is written by the Visual Studio Code extension automatically.\n-   Run `node .genaiscript/genaiscript help run` for the full list of options.\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<details id=\"🎰-variables\" class=\"genaiscript\"><summary>\n🎰 variables\n</summary>\n\n> Variables are referenced through `env.NAME` in prompts.\n-   env.**error**: `ERROR-HTFQOH`\n-   env.**spec**\n\n````````js\n{ filename: \"src/rag/dir.gpspec.md\",\nlabel: \"context\",\ncontent: \"# Specification\\n\\n-   [Document.docx](./Document.docx)\\n-   [L\"... }\n````````\n-   env.**files**\n\n````````js\n[ { label: \"Document.docx\",\n  filename: \"src/rag/Document.docx\",\n  content: \"PK\\u0003\\u0004\\u0014\\u0000\\u0006\\u0000\\b\\u0000\\u0000\\u0000!\\u0000��\\\\�y\\u0001\\u0000\\u0000�\\u0005\\u0000\\u0000\\u0013\\u0000\\b\\u0002[Content_Types].xml �\\u0004\\u0002(�\\u0000\\u0002\\u0000\\u0000\\u0000\"... },\n{ label: \"Lorem Ipsum.pdf\",\n  filename: \"src/rag/Lorem Ipsum.pdf\",\n  content: \"%PDF-1.7\\r\\n%����\\r\\n1 0 obj\\r\\n<</Type/Catalog/Pages 2 0 R/Lang(e\"... },\n{ label: \"markdown.md\",\n  filename: \"src/rag/markdown.md\",\n  content: \"What is Markdown?\\nMarkdown is a lightweight markup language \"... } ]\n````````\n-   env.**parents**\n\n````````js\n[  ]\n````````\n-   env.**fence**\n\n````````markdown\n```\n````````\n-   env.**markdownFence**\n\n````````markdown\n`````\n````````\n-   env.**promptOptions**\n\n````````js\n{  }\n````````\n-   env.**vars**\n\n````````js\n{  }\n````````\n-   env.**functions**\n\n````````js\n[  ]\n````````\n-   env.**schemas**\n\n````````js\n{  }\n````````\n-   env.**template**\n\n````````js\n{ id: \"rag\",\ntitle: \"rag\",\ndescription: undefined }\n````````\n-   env.**secrets**\n\n````````js\n{  }\n````````\n-   env.**chat**\n\n````````js\n{ history: [  ],\nprompt: \"\" }\n````````\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<details id=\"📄-spec\" class=\"genaiscript\"><summary>\n📄 spec\n</summary>\n\n\n````````markdown\n# Specification\n\n-   [Document.docx](./Document.docx)\n-   [Lorem Ipsum.pdf](./Lorem Ipsum.pdf)\n-   [markdown.md](./markdown.md)\n````````\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<details id=\"🛠️-script\" class=\"genaiscript\"><summary>\n🛠️ script\n</summary>\n\n\n\n<details id=\"retreival\" class=\"genaiscript\"><summary>\nretreival\n</summary>\n\n-   query: `markdown`\n-   ✅ indexed src/rag/markdown.md -> src/rag/markdown.md\n-   ✅ indexed src/rag/Document.docx -> src/rag/Document.docx\n-   ✅ indexed src/rag/Lorem Ipsum.pdf -> src/rag/Lorem Ipsum.pdf\n\n````````yaml\n- filename: src/rag/markdown.md\n  id: src/rag/markdown.md_0\n  text: \"What is Markdown?

The point of using\n    Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more -or-less n ormal distribution  of letters,\n    as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like\n    readable English.  Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now\n    use Lorem Ipsum as their default  model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum'\n    wil l uncover many web sites still in their infancy.

Contrary\n    to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a\n    piece of classical  Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years\n    old.

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.  Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.  For example, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., **this text is bold**). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you’re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications.\n\n      ...The screenshot below shows a Markdown file displayed in the Visual Studio Code text editor.\n\n      ...\n  - filename: src/rag/Lorem Ipsum.pdf\n    label: fragments\n    content: |-\n      ...\n      free from repetition, injected humour, or non -characteristic words etc.\n      ...\nfragments:\n  - filename: src/rag/markdown.md\n    content: \"What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.  Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.  For example, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., **this text is bold**).

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.  Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.  For example, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., **this text is bold**). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you’re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications.\n...The screenshot below shows a Markdown file displayed in the Visual Studio Code text editor.\n...\n`````\n\nMARKDOWN:\n```pdf file=src/rag/Lorem Ipsum.pdf\n...\nfree from repetition, injected humour, or non -characteristic words etc.\n...\n```\n\nPDF:\n```pdf file=src/rag/Lorem Ipsum.pdf\n...\nat Hampden -Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one o f the more obscure Latin words,  consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical  literature, discovered the undoubtable source.

It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you’re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications.\n...The screenshot below shows a Markdown file displayed in the Visual Studio Code text editor.\n...\n"},"/workspaces/coarch/packages/sample/src/rag/Lorem Ipsum.pdf":{"before":"%PDF-1.7\r\n%����\r\n1 0 obj\r\n<</Type/Catalog/Pages 2 0 R/Lang(en-IN) /StructTreeRoot 22 0

injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.\n...\nat Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.\n...It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\n...Lorem Ipsum\n\"Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit...\"\n\"There is no one who loves pain itself, who seeks after it and wants to have it, simply because it is pain...\"\nWhat is Lorem Ipsum?\nLorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem

Word is a word processor developed by Microsoft.

Subsequent versions were later written for several other platforms including: IBM PCs running DOS (1983), Apple Macintosh running the Classic Mac OS (1985), AT&T UNIX PC (1985), Atari ST (1988), OS/2 (1989), Microsoft Windows (1989), SCO Unix (1990), macOS (2001), Web browsers (2010), iOS (2014) and Android (2015). Using Wine, versions of Microsoft Word before 2013 can be run on Linux. Commercial versions of Word are licensed as a standalone product or as a component of Microsoft 365 suite of software, which can be purchased either with a perpetual license or as part of a Microsoft 365 subscription, respectively.\n...\n"}},"trace":"## rag\n\n\n\n<details id=\"🤖-automation\" class=\"genaiscript\"><summary>\n🤖 automation\n</summary>\n\nThis operation can be run from the command line:\n\n```bash\nnode .genaiscript/genaiscript.js run rag src/rag/dir --apply-edits\n```\n\n-   You will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).\n-   Configure the OpenAI token in environment variables (run `node .genaiscript/genaiscript help keys` for help).\n-   The `.genaiscript/genaiscript.js` is written by the Visual Studio Code extension automatically.\n-   Run `node .genaiscript/genaiscript help run` for the full list of options.\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<details id=\"🎰-variables\" class=\"genaiscript\"><summary>\n🎰 variables\n</summary>\n\n> Variables are referenced through `env.NAME` in prompts.\n-   env.**error**: `ERROR-IWBQHB`\n-   env.**spec**\n\n````````js\n{ filename: \"src/rag/dir.gpspec.md\",\nlabel: \"context\",\ncontent: \"# Specification\\n\\n-   [Document.docx](./Document.docx)\\n-   [L\"... }\n````````\n-   env.**files**\n\n````````js\n[ { label: \"Document.docx\",\n  filename: \"src/rag/Document.docx\",\n  content: \"PK\\u0003\\u0004\\u0014\\u0000\\u0006\\u0000\\b\\u0000\\u0000\\u0000!\\u0000��\\\\�y\\u0001\\u0000\\u0000�\\u0005\\u0000\\u0000\\u0013\\u0000\\b\\u0002[Content_Types].xml �\\u0004\\u0002(�\\u0000\\u0002\\u0000\\u0000\\u0000\"... },\n{ label: \"Lorem Ipsum.pdf\",\n  filename: \"src/rag/Lorem Ipsum.pdf\",\n  content: \"%PDF-1.7\\r\\n%����\\r\\n1 0 obj\\r\\n<</Type/Catalog/Pages 2 0 R/Lang(e\"... },\n{ label: \"markdown.md\",\n  filename: \"src/rag/markdown.md\",\n  content: \"What is Markdown?\\nMarkdown is a lightweight markup language \"... } ]\n````````\n-   env.**parents**\n\n````````js\n[  ]\n````````\n-   env.**fence**\n\n````````markdown\n```\n````````\n-   env.**markdownFence**\n\n````````markdown\n`````\n````````\n-   env.**promptOptions**\n\n````````js\n{  }\n````````\n-   env.**vars**\n\n````````js\n{  }\n````````\n-   env.**functions**\n\n````````js\n[  ]\n````````\n-   env.**schemas**\n\n````````js\n{  }\n````````\n-   env.**template**\n\n````````js\n{ id: \"rag\",\ntitle: \"rag\",\ndescription: undefined }\n````````\n-   env.**secrets**\n\n````````js\n{  }\n````````\n-   env.**chat**\n\n````````js\n{ history: [  ],\nprompt: \"\" }\n````````\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<details id=\"📄-spec\" class=\"genaiscript\"><summary>\n📄 spec\n</summary>\n\n\n````````markdown\n# Specification\n\n-   [Document.docx](./Document.docx)\n-   [Lorem Ipsum.pdf](./Lorem Ipsum.pdf)\n-   [markdown.md](./markdown.md)\n````````\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<details id=\"🛠️-script\" class=\"genaiscript\"><summary>\n🛠️ script\n</summary>\n\n\n\n<details id=\"retreive-`markdown`\" class=\"genaiscript\"><summary>\nretreive `markdown`\n</summary>\n\n-   ✅ indexed src/rag/markdown.md -> src/rag/markdown.md\n-   ✅ src/rag/Document.docx\n-   ✅ src/rag/Lorem Ipsum.pdf\n\n````````yaml\nfiles:\n  - filename: src/rag/markdown.md\n    label: fragments\n    content: >-\n      ...\n\n      What is Markdown? Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.  Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.  For example, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., **this text is bold**). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you’re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications.\n\n      ...The screenshot below shows a Markdown file displayed in the Visual Studio Code text editor.\n\n      ...\n  - filename: src/rag/Lorem Ipsum.pdf\n    label: fragments\n    content: |-\n      ...\n      free from repetition, injected humour, or non -characteristic words etc.\n      ...\nfragments:\n  - filename: src/rag/markdown.md\n    content: \"What is Markdown?

When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages. Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different. For example, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., **this text is bold**). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you’re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications.\n...The screenshot below shows a Markdown file displayed in the Visual Studio Code text editor.\n...\n\n`````\n\n\n-   `File src/rag/Lorem Ipsum.pdf` \n\n`````markdown\n...\nfree from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.\n...\nat Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.  Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.  For example, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., **this text is bold**). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you’re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications.\n...The screenshot below shows a Markdown file displayed in the Visual Studio Code text editor.\n...\n`````\n\nMARKDOWN:\n```pdf file=src/rag/Lorem Ipsum.pdf\n...\nfree from repetition, injected humour, or non -characteristic words etc.\n...\n```\n\nPDF:\n```pdf file=src/rag/Lorem Ipsum.pdf\n...\nat Hampden -Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one o f the more obscure Latin words,  consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical  literature, discovered the undoubtable source.

Lorem Ipsum has been\nthe industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley\nof type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but\nalso the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in\nthe 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more\nrecently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem\nIpsum.\nWhy do we use it?\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when\nlooking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution\nof letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.\nMany desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default\nmodel text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various\nversions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected\nhumour and the like).\n\nWhere does it come from?\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical\nLatin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor\nat Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,\nconsectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical\nliterature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and\n1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written\nin 45 BC.

The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution\nof letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.\nMany desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default\nmodel text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various\nversions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected\nhumour and the like).\n\nWhere does it come from?\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical\nLatin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor\nat Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,\nconsectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical\nliterature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and\n1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written\nin 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The\nfirst line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\n\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those\ninterested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are\nalso reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914\ntranslation by H. Rackham.\n\nWhere can I get some?\nThere are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered\nalteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly\nbelievable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't\nanything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet\ntend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.\n```\n\nSummarize the content of FILE.\n````````\n\n</details>\n\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<details id=\"🧠-llm-request-(2-messages)\" class=\"genaiscript\"><summary>\n🧠 llm request (2 messages)\n</summary>\n\n-   temperature: 0.2 (max cached: 0.01)\n-   top_p: undefined (max cached: 0.5)\n-   OpenAI chat request\n-   model: gpt-4\n-   url: [https://tnrllmproxy.azurewebsites.net/openai/deployments/gpt-4/chat/completions?api-version=2023-09-01-preview](https://tnrllmproxy.azurewebsites.net/openai/deployments/gpt-4/chat/completions?api-version=2023-09-01-preview)\n-   response: 200 OK\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<details id=\"📩-llm-response\" class=\"genaiscript\"><summary>\n📩 llm response\n</summary>\n\nThe file is a document about Lorem Ipsum, a standard dummy text used in the printing and typesetting industry.

Richard McClintock, a Latin professor\nat Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,\nconsectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical\nliterature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and\n1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written\nin 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The\nfirst line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\n\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those\ninterested.

Rackham.\n\nWhere can I get some?\nThere are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered\nalteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly\nbelievable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't\nanything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.

Various\nversions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected\nhumour and the like).\n\nWhere does it come from?\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical\nLatin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor\nat Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,\nconsectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical\nliterature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and\n1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written\nin 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The\nfirst line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\n\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those\ninterested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are\nalso reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914\ntranslation by H. Rackham.\n\nWhere can I get some?\nThere are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered\nalteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly\nbelievable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't\nanything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet\ntend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.\n\n-------- Page Break --------\n\nLorem Ipsum\n\"Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci\nvelit...\"\n\"There is no one who loves pain itself, who seeks after it and wants to have it, simply because it is pain...\"\n\nWhat is Lorem Ipsum?\nLorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been\nthe industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley\nof type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but\nalso the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages. Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different. For example, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., **this text is bold**). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you’re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications. The screenshot below shows a Markdown file displayed in the Visual Studio Code text editor.\n...\n`````\n\nMARKDOWN:\n```docx file=packages/sample/src/rag/Document.docx\n...\nMicrosoft Word is a word processor developed by Microsoft.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been \r\nthe industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley \r\nof type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but \r\nalso the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in \r\nthe  1960s  with  the  release  of  Letraset  sheets  containing  Lorem  Ipsum  passages,  and  more \r\nrecently  with  desktop  publishing  software  like Aldus  PageMaker  including  versions  of  Lorem \r\nIpsum. Why do we use it? It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when \r\nlooking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution \r\nof letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default \r\nmodel text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various \r\nversions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected \r\nhumour and the like). Where does it come from? Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical \r\nLatin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor \r\nat  Hampden-Sydney  College  in  Virginia,  looked  up  one  of  the  more  obscure  Latin  words, \r\nconsectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical \r\nliterature,  discovered  the  undoubtable  source. Lorem  Ipsum  comes  from  sections  1.10.32  and \r\n1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written \r\nin 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The \r\nfirst line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard  chunk  of  Lorem  Ipsum  used  since  the  1500s  is  reproduced  below  for  those \r\ninterested. Sections 1.10.32  and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are \r\nalso  reproduced  in  their  exact  original  form,  accompanied  by  English  versions  from the  1914 \r\ntranslation by H. Rackham. Where can I get some? There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered \r\nalteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly \r\nbelievable. If you  are going  to use  a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you  need to be  sure there isn't \r\nanything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet \r\ntend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.\n...It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, \r\nto generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always \r\nfree from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.\n...\n```\n\nWORD:\n```docx file=packages/sample/src/rag/Document.docx\n...\nMicrosoft Word is a word processor developed by Microsoft.

When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.

Sections 1.10.32  and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are \r\nalso  reproduced  in  their  exact  original  form,  accompanied  by  English  versions  from the  1914 \r\ntranslation by H. Rackham. Where can I get some? There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered \r\nalteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly \r\nbelievable. If you  are going  to use  a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you  need to be  sure there isn't \r\nanything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet \r\ntend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.\n...It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, \r\nto generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always \r\nfree from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.\n...\n```\n\nWORD:\n```docx file=packages/sample/src/rag/Document.docx\n...\nMicrosoft Word is a word processor developed by Microsoft.

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages. Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different. For example, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., **this text is bold**). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you’re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the\n      printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been \\r\n\n      the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an\n      unknown printer took a galley \\r\n\n      of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has\n      survived not only five centuries, but \\r\n\n      also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially\n      unchanged. It was popularised in \\r\n\n      the  1960s  with  the  release  of  Letraset  sheets  containing  L\\\n      orem  Ipsum  passages,  and  more \\r\n\n      recently  with  desktop  publishing  software  like\n      Aldus  PageMaker  including  versions  of  Lorem \\r\n\n      Ipsum. Why do we use it? It is a long established fact that a reader\n      will be distracted by the readable content of a page when \\r\n\n      looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has\n      a more-or-less normal distribution \\r\n\n      of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making\n      it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web\n      page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default \\r\n\n      model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web\n      sites still in their infancy. Various \\r\n\n      versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident,\n      sometimes on purpose (injected \\r\n\n      humour and the like). Where does it come from? Contrary to popular\n      belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of\n      classical \\r\n\n      Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard\n      McClintock, a Latin professor \\r\n\n      at  Hampden-Sydney  College  in  Virginia,  looked  up  one  of  th\\\n      e  more  obscure  Latin  words, \\r\n\n      consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites\n      of the word in classical \\r\n\n      literature,  discovered  the  undoubtable  source.\n      Lorem  Ipsum  comes  from  sections  1.10.32  and \\r\n\n      1.10.33 of \\\"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\\\" (The Extremes of Good\n      and Evil) by Cicero, written \\r\n\n      in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very\n      popular during the Renaissance. The \\r\n\n      first line of Lorem Ipsum, \\\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\\\", comes\n      from a line in section 1.10.32. The\n      standard  chunk  of  Lorem  Ipsum  used  since  the  1500s  is  reproduce\\\n      d  below  for  those \\r\n\n      interested.

Contrary to popular\n      belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of\n      classical \\r\n\n      Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.

It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you’re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications.

It is used to provide a standard layout of text that does not distract the reader with its content. Lorem Ipsum has a normal distribution of letters and is used in various desktop publishing packages and web page editors. It originates from a work of classical Latin literature from 45 BC by Cicero. The text is often used when looking for passages that won't be mistaken for English to demonstrate typographic features. Variations of Lorem Ipsum may include randomised words or injected humour.\n\n`````\n\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<details id=\"🖊-edits\" class=\"genaiscript\"><summary>\n🖊 edits\n</summary>\n\n| Type | Filename | Message |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| createfile | /workspaces/coarch/packages/sample/packages/sample/src/rag/markdown.md | Create /workspaces/coarch/packages/sample/packages/sample/src/rag/markdown.md |\n| createfile | /workspaces/coarch/packages/sample/packages/sample/src/rag/Document.docx | Create /workspaces/coarch/packages/sample/packages/sample/src/rag/Document.docx |\n| createfile | /workspaces/coarch/packages/sample/packages/sample/src/rag/loremipsum.pdf | Create /workspaces/coarch/packages/sample/packages/sample/src/rag/loremipsum.pdf |\n</details>\n\n"}}

Lorem  Ipsum  comes  from  sections  1.10.32  and \r\n1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written \r\nin 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The \r\nfirst line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

Word is a word processor developed by Microsoft. It was first released on October 25, 1983, under the name Multi-Tool Word for Xenix systems. Subsequent versions were later written for several other platforms including IBM PCs running DOS, Apple Macintosh running the Classic Mac OS, AT&T UNIX PC, Atari ST, OS/2, Microsoft Windows, SCO Unix, macOS, Web browsers, iOS and Android. Using Wine, versions of Microsoft Word before 2013 can be run on Linux. Commercial versions of Word are licensed as a standalone product or as a component of Microsoft 365 suite of software, which can be purchased either with a perpetual license or as part of a Microsoft 365 subscription, respectively.\n"}},"trace":"## rag\n\n\n\n<details id=\"🤖-automation\" class=\"genaiscript\"><summary>\n🤖 automation\n</summary>\n\nThis operation can be run from the command line:\n\n```bash\nnode .genaiscript/genaiscript.js run rag src/rag/dir --apply-edits\n```\n\n-   You will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).\n-   Configure the OpenAI token in environment variables (run `node .genaiscript/genaiscript help keys` for help).\n-   The `.genaiscript/genaiscript.js` is written by the Visual Studio Code extension automatically.\n-   Run `node .genaiscript/genaiscript help run` for the full list of options.\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<details id=\"🎰-variables\" class=\"genaiscript\"><summary>\n🎰 variables\n</summary>\n\n> Variables are referenced through `env.NAME` in prompts.\n-   env.**error**: `ERROR-RCLKOQ`\n-   env.**spec**\n\n````````js\n{ filename: \"src/rag/dir.gpspec.md\",\nlabel: \"context\",\ncontent: \"# Specification\\n\\n-   [Document.docx](./Document.docx)\\n-   [l\"... }\n````````\n-   env.**files**\n\n````````js\n[ { label: \"Document.docx\",\n  filename: \"src/rag/Document.docx\",\n  content: undefined },\n{ label: \"loremipsum.pdf\",\n  filename: \"src/rag/loremipsum.pdf\",\n  content: undefined },\n{ label: \"markdown.md\",\n  filename: \"src/rag/markdown.md\",\n  content: \"What is Markdown?\\nMarkdown is a lightweight markup language \"... } ]\n````````\n-   env.**parents**\n\n````````js\n[  ]\n````````\n-   env.**fence**\n\n````````markdown\n```\n````````\n-   env.**markdownFence**\n\n````````markdown\n`````\n````````\n-   env.**promptOptions**\n\n````````js\n{  }\n````````\n-   env.**vars**\n\n````````js\n{  }\n````````\n-   env.**functions**\n\n````````js\n[  ]\n````````\n-   env.**schemas**\n\n````````js\n{  }\n````````\n-   env.**template**\n\n````````js\n{ id: \"rag\",\ntitle: \"rag\",\ndescription: undefined }\n````````\n-   env.**secrets**\n\n````````js\n{  }\n````````\n-   env.**chat**\n\n````````js\n{ history: [  ],\nprompt: \"\" }\n````````\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<details id=\"📄-spec\" class=\"genaiscript\"><summary>\n📄 spec\n</summary>\n\n\n````````markdown\n# Specification\n\n-   [Document.docx](./Document.docx)\n-   [loremipsum.pdf](./loremipsum.pdf)\n-   [markdown.md](./markdown.md)\n````````\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<details id=\"🛠️-script\" class=\"genaiscript\"><summary>\n🛠️ script\n</summary>\n\n\n\n<details id=\"retreive-`markdown`\" class=\"genaiscript\"><summary>\nretreive `markdown`\n</summary>\n\n-   ✅ src/rag/Document.docx\n-   ✅ src/rag/loremipsum.pdf\n-   ✅ src/rag/markdown.md\n\n````````yaml\nfiles:\n  - filename: src/rag/markdown.md\n    label: fragments\n    content: >-\n      ...\n\n      What is Markdown? Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages. Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different. For example, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., **this text is bold**). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you’re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications.

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages. Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different. For example, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., **this text is bold**). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you’re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications.

Why do we use it? It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when \r\nlooking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution \r\nof letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default \r\nmodel text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various \r\nversions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected \r\nhumour and the like). Where does it come from? Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical \r\nLatin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor \r\nat  Hampden-Sydney  College  in  Virginia,  looked  up  one  of  the  more  obscure  Latin  words, \r\nconsectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical \r\nliterature,  discovered  the  undoubtable  source. Lorem  Ipsum  comes  from  sections  1.10.32  and \r\n1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written \r\nin 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The \r\nfirst line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

Rackham. Where can I get some? There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered \r\nalteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly \r\nbelievable.

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages. Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different. For example, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., **this text is bold**). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you’re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications. The screenshot below shows a Markdown file displayed in the Visual Studio Code text editor.\n```\n\nFile packages/sample/src/rag/markdown.md:\n```markdown\nWhat is Markdown?

Why do we use it? It is a long established fact that a reader\n      will be distracted by the readable content of a page when \\r\n\n      looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has\n      a more-or-less normal distribution \\r\n\n      of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making\n      it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web\n      page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default \\r\n\n      model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web\n      sites still in their infancy. Various \\r\n\n      versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident,\n      sometimes on purpose (injected \\r\n\n      humour and the like). Where does it come from? Contrary to popular\n      belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of\n      classical \\r\n\n      Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard\n      McClintock, a Latin professor \\r\n\n      at  Hampden-Sydney  College  in  Virginia,  looked  up  one  of  th\\\n      e  more  obscure  Latin  words, \\r\n\n      consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites\n      of the word in classical \\r\n\n      literature,  discovered  the  undoubtable  source.\n      Lorem  Ipsum  comes  from  sections  1.10.32  and \\r\n\n      1.10.33 of \\\"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\\\" (The Extremes of Good\n      and Evil) by Cicero, written \\r\n\n      in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very\n      popular during the Renaissance. The \\r\n\n      first line of Lorem Ipsum, \\\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\\\", comes\n      from a line in section 1.10.32. The\n      standard  chunk  of  Lorem  Ipsum  used  since  the  1500s  is  reproduce\\\n      d  below  for  those \\r\n\n      interested. Sections 1.10.32  and 1.10.33 from \\\"de Finibus Bonorum\n      et Malorum\\\" by Cicero are \\r\n\n      also  reproduced  in  their  exact  original  form,  accompanied  b\\\n      y  English  versions  from the  1914 \\r\n\n      translation by H. Rackham. Where can I get some? There are many\n      variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have\n      suffered \\r\n\n      alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words\n      which don't look even slightly \\r\n\n      believable. If you  are going  to use  a passage of Lorem Ipsum,\n      you  need to be  sure there isn't \\r\n\n      anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages. Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different. For example, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., **this text is bold**). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you’re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications.

The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution \r\nof letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.

Various \r\nversions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected \r\nhumour and the like). Where does it come from? Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical \r\nLatin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor \r\nat  Hampden-Sydney  College  in  Virginia,  looked  up  one  of  the  more  obscure  Latin  words, \r\nconsectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical \r\nliterature,  discovered  the  undoubtable  source. Lorem  Ipsum  comes  from  sections  1.10.32  and \r\n1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written \r\nin 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The \r\nfirst line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

Lorem Ipsum has been \r\nthe industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley \r\nof type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but \r\nalso the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in \r\nthe  1960s  with  the  release  of  Letraset  sheets  containing  Lorem  Ipsum  passages,  and  more \r\nrecently  with  desktop  publishing  software  like Aldus  PageMaker  including  versions  of  Lorem \r\nIpsum. Why do we use it? It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when \r\nlooking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution \r\nof letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default \r\nmodel text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various \r\nversions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected \r\nhumour and the like). Where does it come from? Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical \r\nLatin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor \r\nat  Hampden-Sydney  College  in  Virginia,  looked  up  one  of  the  more  obscure  Latin  words, \r\nconsectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical \r\nliterature,  discovered  the  undoubtable  source. Lorem  Ipsum  comes  from  sections  1.10.32  and \r\n1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written \r\nin 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The \r\nfirst line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard  chunk  of  Lorem  Ipsum  used  since  the  1500s  is  reproduced  below  for  those \r\ninterested. Sections 1.10.32  and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are \r\nalso  reproduced  in  their  exact  original  form,  accompanied  by  English  versions  from the  1914 \r\ntranslation by H. Rackham. Where can I get some? There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered \r\nalteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly \r\nbelievable. If you  are going  to use  a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you  need to be  sure there isn't \r\nanything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages. Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different. For example, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., **this text is bold**). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you’re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications. The screenshot below shows a Markdown file displayed in the Visual Studio Code text editor.\n```\n\nFile packages/sample/src/rag/markdown.md:\n```markdown\nWhat is Markdown?

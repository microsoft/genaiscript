ChangedCode@9-9:
[9] Annotations are markers such as errors, warnings, or notes that can be incorporated into LLM output. They can be extracted and integrated into VSCode or CI environments.

OriginalCode@17-19:
[17] If you use \`annotation\` in your script text and you do not specify the \`system\` field, \`system.annotations\` will be added by default.
[18] 
[19] Using the \`system.annotations\` system prompt, you can have the LLM generate errors, warnings and notes.
ChangedCode@17-19:
[17] If you include \`annotation\` in your script text without specifying the \`system\` field, \`system.annotations\` will be appended by default.
[18] 
[19] Utilizing the \`system.annotations\` system prompt enables the LLM to generate errors, warnings, and notes.

OriginalCode@30-31:
[30] The \`system.annotations\` prompt automatically enables line number injection for all \`def\` section. This helps
[31] with the precision of the LLM answer and reduces hallucinations.
ChangedCode@30-31:
[30] The \`system.annotations\` prompt automatically facilitates line number injection for all \`def\` sections, which
[31] enhances the accuracy of the LLM's responses and mitigates the occurrence of hallucinations.

[47] The [SARIF Viewer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-SarifVSCode.sarif-viewer)
[48] extension can be used to visualize the reports.
